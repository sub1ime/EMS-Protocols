"11", "Heart Failure", "Heart failure is generally divided into left ventricular failure and right ventricular failure. Left ventricular heart failure is the inability of the left ventricle to adequately move blood into the systemic circulation. In left ventricular failure, an imbalance in the output of the two sides of the heart occurs. The left ventricle is unable to move all the blood delivered to it from the right side of the heart. Left ventricular followed by left atrial pressure rises and is transmitted back to the pulmonary circulation. When the pressure in the pulmonary vessels becomes too high, blood serum is forced into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema. In right ventricular heart failure the right side of the heart fails to function as an adequate pump, which leads to back pressure which leads to back pressure into the venous circulation. This is most commonly caused by left heart failure, which subsequently progresses to right heart failure. The patient’s symptoms should assist in determining left versus right heart failure, or both. Signs of left sided heart failure include rales / crackles, tachypnea while right-sided failure will create JVD, ascites, and peripheral edema. The management goal of patients with HF involves decreasing cardiac workload by reducing both preload and afterload.", "/b Congestive heart failure\n/b Past medical history\n/b Medications (digoxin, lasix, Bumex)\n/b Erectile dysfunction meds: Cialis® (Tadalafil), Viagra® (Sildenafil), Levitra® (Vardenafil HCl)\n/b Cardiac history\n/b Myocardial infarction", "/b Respiratory distress, rales\n/b Apprehension, orthopnea\n/b Jugular vein distention\n/b Pink, frothy sputum\n/b Peripheral pitting edema\n/b Diaphoresis\n/b Tripod positioning\n/b Inability to speak in full sentences\n/b Accessory muscle usage with respiration \n/b Hypotension, shock\n/b Chest pain", "/b  Myocardial Infarction\n/b  Asthma\n/b Anaphylaxis\n/b Aspiration\n/b COPD\n/b Pleural effusion\n/b Pneumonia\n/b Pulmonary Embolus\n/b Pericardial Tamponade", "1. The possibility of myocardial infarction should be assessed in all patients presenting with HF.\n2. If the patient is currently taking daily diuretics, double the patient’s normal prescribed dose.\n3. In left ventricular failure, the apical pulse is usually displaced laterally and downward. There may additionally be a paradoxically split S 2 / S 3 gallop.\n4. In right ventricular failure, S 3 is often heard with a holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.\n5. Advise the receiving facility of CPAP initiation early so they can have CPAP ready on arrival.\n6. Upon arrival at hospital, advocate for patient to remain on CPAP and do not remove CPAP until hospital equivalent respiratory therapy is ready to be placed on patient."
"12", "Cardiogenic Shock", "Shock is often defined as a state of inadequate tissue perfusion. This may result in acidosis, derangements of cellular metabolism, potential end-organ damage, and death. Early in the shock process, patients are able to compensate for decreased perfusion by increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to tachycardia and tachypnea. Later, compensatory mechanisms fail, causing a decreased mental status, hypotension, and death. Early cellular injury may be reversible if definitive therapy is delivered promptly.", "/b Blood loss (vaginal or gastrointestinal)\n/b AAA, ectopic\n/b Fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhea)\n/b Fever\n/b Infection\n/b Cardiac ischemia (MI, HF)\n/b Medications\n/b Allergic Reaction\n/b Pregnancy", "/b Restlessness, confusion\n/b  Weakness, dizziness\n/b  Weak, rapid pulse\n/b Pale, cool, clammy skin\n/b Delayed capillary refill\n/b Difficulty breathing\n/b Hypotension\n/b Coffee-ground emesis\n/b Tarry stools", "/b Shock\n/b  Hypovolemic\n/b Cardiogenic\n/b Septic\n/b Neurogenic\n/b Anaphylactic\n/b Ectopic pregnancy\n/b Dysrhythmia\n/b Pulmonary embolus\n/b Tension pneumothorax\n/b Medication effect, overdose\n/b Vaso-vagal\n/b Physiologic (pregnancy)", "1.

Pulmonary edema / HF may cause cardiogenic shock.\n4. Marked, symptomatic tachycardia and bradycardia will cause cardiogenic shock."
"13", "Aortic Dissection & AAA", "Aortic Aneurysms (AA) are a degenerative and progressively slow process where the walls of the aorta weaken and expand due to the systemic pressures of the circulatory system. The formation of aneurysms can be attributed to atherosclerosis, infection, trauma, hypertension, and inherited disorders. AAs generally form in the abdominal section of the aorta and present with weak or absent pulses in the lower extremities, cooler temperatures in the lower extremities, a central abdominal mass that can sometimes have pulsations, and abdominal and/ or back pain. If the aneurysm ruptures, chance of survival is very low and requires immediate surgical intervention. Aortic Dissections usually occur in the thoracic cavity when the aortic intima is torn away, exposing the media layer. The pulse pressure from the systemic circulation then begins to dissect the two layers of the aortic wall and creates a false lumen or pouch in the wall of the aorta. Conditions associated with the formation of an aortic dissection include:\nhypertension, Marfan’s Syndrome, aortic valve abnormalities, immune disorders, atherosclerosis, and patients in the third trimester of pregnancy. \nWhen left untreated, about 33% of patients die within the first 24 hours, and 50% die within 48 hours. The 2 - week mortality rate approaches 75% in patients with undiagnosed ascending aortic dissection[1].

Treatment goals are to maintain systolic BP 90 -120 mmHg and heart rate between 50 - 80 bpm.\n2. Do not delay transport for any reason if possible, interventions should be done enroute to appropriate facility.\n3. Abdominal mass may not be palpable in obese patients.\n4. Physical examination may reveal a murmur of aortic insufficiency.\n5. Type A dissection occurs in the ascending aorta, while a Type B dissection occurs just distal to the left subclavian artery."
"14", "BLS Pulseless Arrest", "", "", "", "", "1. If airway is maintainable initially with a BVM, delay rescue airway insertion until after initial defibrillation. The best airway is an effective airway with the least potential complications.\n2. Continue CPR while AED is charging.\n3. CPR should not be stopped for any reason, if at all avoidable, other than to check for rhythm post-defibrillation. Any stop of compressions should be kept as short as possible, preferably a maximum of 10 seconds.\n4. Rescue airway placement should be performed during compressions.\n5. Pay close attention to rate of manual ventilation. The rate should be maintained at 8 - 10 breaths per minute. Hyperventilation should be avoided because it decreases preload, cardiac output, coronary perfusion, and cerebral blood flow. The oxygenation goal is to maintain a SPO 2 of 94 - 99% throughout resuscitation."
"15", "ALS Adult Cardiac Arrest", "Cardiac arrest can be caused by Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Pulseless Electric Activity (PEA), and asystole. VF represents disorganized electric activity, whereas pulseless VT represents organized electric activity of the ventricular myocardium. Neither of these rhythms generates significant forward blood flow. PEA encompasses a heterogeneous group of organized electric rhythms that are associated with either absence of mechanical ventricular activity or mechanical ventricular activity that is insufficient to generate a clinically detectable pulse. Asystole (perhaps better described as ventricular asystole) represents absence of detectable ventricular electric activity with or without atrial electric activity. The foundation of successful ACLS is high quality CPR, and, for VF / pulseless VT, attempted defibrillation within minutes of collapse. For victims of witnessed VF arrest, early CPR and rapid defibrillation can significantly increase the chance for survival to hospital discharge.", "", "", "", ""
"16", "Tachycardia with a Pulse", "Tachycardia’s can be classified in several ways, based on the appearance of the QRS complex, heart rate, and regularity. ACLS professionals should be able to recognize and differentiate between sinus tachycardia, narrow-complex SupraVentricular Tachycardia (SVT), and wide-complex tachycardia. Because ACLS providers may be unable to distinguish between supraventricular and ventricular rhythms, they should be aware that most wide-complex (broad-complex) tachycardias are ventricular in origin.", "/b Past medical history\n/b Medications: (Aminophylline, Diet Pills, Thyroid Supplements, Decongestants, Digoxin)\n/b Diet (caffeine, chocolate)\n/b Drugs (nicotine, cocaine)\n/b History of palpitations / heart racing\n/b Syncope / near syncope", "/b Heart rate > 150 bpm\n/b Dizziness\n/b Chest Pain\n/b Shortness of Breath\n/b Potential presenting rhythm: Sinus tachycardia, Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter, Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)", "=='''QRS < 0.12 ms'''==\n/b Sinus tachycardia\n/b  Atrial fibrillation\n/b  Atrial flutter\n/b  AV nodal reentry\n/b  Accessory pathway – mediated tachycardia\n/b Atrial tachycardia (including automatic and reentry forms)\n/b Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)\n/b Junctional tachycardia (rare in adults)\n\n=='''QRS > 0.12 ms'''==\n/b  Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation(VF)\n/b  SVT with aberrancy\n/b  Pre-excitation tachycardia’s (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome)\n/b Ventricular paced rhythms", "1. Approved vagal maneuvers include coughing, bearing down as if attempting a bowel movement, and attempting to blow plunger out of 10 mL syringe. '''''Carotid sinus massage and / or ocular massage are not approved'''''.\n2. Irregular narrow-complex tachycardias are likely atrial fibrillation or MAT; occasionally atrial flutter is irregular.\n3. Each dose of Adenosine should be drawn up completely in a 5 ml syringe. Both the Adenosine and a 10 ml syringe of NS should be inserted, together, in the port closest to the IV catheter. Adenosine should be administered rapid IVP followed immediately by the Normal Saline flush administered rapid IVP. Due to the half-life of Adenosine, this is the only way to assure its efficacy and safety. Slow administration allows for a prolonged effect on the SA and AV node, which may result in prolonged bradycardia or asystole after rhythm converts.\n4. Patients with past history of SVT conversion by Adenosine alone are more likely to convert by medication alone. Those who do not convert easily are patients on aminophylline, or similar agents (including high dose caffeine ingestion). A proper history should include number of conversions in past, and whether cardioversion was necessary."
"17", "Bradycardia", "Brady-arrhythmias can be caused by two mechanisms: depression of sinus nodal activity or conduction system blocks. In both situations, subsidiary pacemakers take over and pace the heart, provided the pacemaker is located above the bifurcation of the Bundle of His, and the rate is generally adequate to maintain cardiac output. The need for emergent treatment is guided by two considerations: evidence of hypoperfusion and the potential of the rhythm to degenerate into a more profound bradycardia or Asystole.", "/b  Past medical history\n/b Medications (Beta Blockers, Calcium channel blockers, Clonidine, Digitalis)\n/b Pacemaker", "/b Heart rate < 60 bpm\n/b Chest pain\n/b Respiratory distress\n/b  Hypotension or shock\n/b  Altered mental status\n/b  Syncope", "/b Acute myocardial infarction\n/b Hypoxia\n/b Hypothermia\n/b Sinus bradycardia\n/b Athletes\n/b Head injury (elevated ICP) or stroke\n/b Spinal cord lesion\n/b Sick sinus syndrome\n/b AV blocks (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree)", "1. Symptomatic 2nd and 3rd degree heart block should be treated with transcutaneous pacing, avoid Atropine.\n2. In the setting of AMI or suspected acute cardiac ischemia, transcutaneous pacing should be first, only if the patient is showing profound symptoms of poor perfusion.\n3. Electrical capture during transcutaneous pacing is defined as an electrical stimulus marker followed by a wide QRS complex, with no underlying intrinsic rhythm, followed by a T - wave. This should occur for each electrical complex.\n4. Mechanical capture is confirmed when the patient’s pulse matches the displayed pace rate. Because pacing stimuli generally causes muscular contractions that can be mistaken for a pulse, you should never take a pulse on the left side of the body to confirm mechanical capture. Pectoral muscle contractions due to pacing also do not indicate mechanical capture. To avoid mistaking muscular response to pacing stimuli for arterial pulsations, use ONLY: (1) right femoral artery or (2) right brachial for confirming mechanical capture. Acute myocardial infarcts can present with hypotension and brady-arrhythmias.\n5. Obtain 12-Lead ECG.\n6. If hypotension exists with bradycardia, treat the bradycardia.\n7. If blood pressure is adequate, monitor only.\n8. Treatment of bradycardia is based upon the presence or absence of significant signs and symptoms (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic)."
"18", "Medical Assessment", "The ability to perform an accurate assessment is one of the most important skills in EMS. The information gained during the assessment is used to make decisions regarding emergency interventions, such as the need for immediate airway management and ventilation; to formulate a differential field diagnosis; and to provide continued and advanced pre-hospital care enroute to a receiving facility. Since this information is used in clinical decision-making, it is important that the assessment findings are interpreted correctly and efficiently.", "", "", "", ""
"19", "Abdominal Pain", "Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints in emergency medicine. In nearly half the patients, the etiology remains obscure. Recalling the differences between generalized types of pain can be helpful diagnostically. Visceral abdominal pain results from stretching of the autonomic nerve fibers. The pain may be described as cramp like, colicky or gaseous and is often intermittent. Obstruction can be a serious cause of visceral pain. Somatic pain occurs when pain fibers located in the parietal peritoneum are irritated by chemical or bacterial inflammation. The pain is described as sharp, more constant, and more precisely located. Referred pain is any pain felt at a distance from a diseased organ. Referred pain generally follows certain classic patterns, for example, diaphragmatic irritation often radiates to the supra-clavicular area.", "/b Age\n/b Past medical, surgical history\n/b Medications\n/b Time of onset\n/b Palliation, provocation\n/b Quality (cramping, constant, sharp, dull, etc)\n/b Region, radiation, referred\n/b Severity (1 - 10)\n/b Duration, repetition\n/b Fever\n/b Last meal\n/b Last bowel movement, consistency\n/b Menstrual history, pregnancy", "", "", ""
