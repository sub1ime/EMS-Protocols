Shock
================================

OVERVIEW:
--------------------------------
Shock is defined as a state of inadequate tissue perfusion. This may result in acidosis, derangements of cellular metabolism, potential end-organ damage, and death. Early in the shock process, patients are able to compensate for decreased perfusion by increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to tachycardia and tachypnea. Later, compensatory mechanisms fail, causing a decreased mental status, hypotension, and death. Early cellular injury may be reversible if definitive therapy is delivered promptly.

HPI
----------------------
• Blood loss (vaginal or gastrointestinal)
• AAA, ectopic
• Fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhea)
• Fever
• Infection
• Cardiac ischemia (MI, HF)
• Medications
• Allergic Reaction
• Pregnancy

Signs and Symptoms
-----------------------------------
• Restlessness, confusion
• Weakness, dizziness
• Weak, rapid pulse
• Pale, cool, clammy skin
• Delayed capillary refill
• Hypotension
• Coffee-ground emesis
• Tarry stools

Considerations
--------------------------
• Shock
   o Hypovolemic
   o Cardiogenic
   o Septic
   o Neurogenic
   o Anaphylactic
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Dysrhythmia
• Pulmonary embolus
• Tension pneumothorax
• Medication effect, overdose
• Vaso-vagal
• Physiologic (pregnancy)

Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Assess for signs of shock including, but not limited to:
• Restlessness, altered mental status, hypoperfusion
(cool, pale, moist skin), tachypnea (rapid breathing),
rapid, weak pulse, orthostatic hypotension (blood
pressure suddenly drops on standing up), nausea
and thirst.
4. Administer oxygen per patient assessment to maintain
SpO 2 between 94 - 99%. Support respirations as
necessary with a BVM.
5. Transport as soon as possible.
6. Control external bleeding with direct pressure, then
tourniquet if direct pressure is inadequate.
7. If pregnant (uterine fundus above umbilicus), place the
patient on her left side.
8. Maintain body temperature by protecting the patient from
the environment, removing wet clothing and covering the
patient with a blanket.
9. Establish a large bore IV or IO of Normal Saline. If time
permits, establish second access.
• Do not delay transport to establish vascular access.
10. Give a 20 mL / kg bolus. If no improvement after the first
20 mL / kg bolus, may repeat once. While administering
a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for
improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO
and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload
respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi,
decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.

Classes of Shock
---------------------------------
<b>Hypovolemic</b>
Caused by hemorrhage, burns, or dehydration.

<b>Distributive</b>
Maldistribution of  blood, caused by poor vasomotor tone in neurogenic shock, sepsis, anaphylaxis, severe hypoxia, or metabolic shock.

<b>Cardiogenic</b>
Caused by necrosis of the myocardial tissue, or by arrhythmias.

<b>Obstructive</b>
Caused by impairment of cardiac filling, found in pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, or cardiac Tamponade.

PEARLS:
----------------------------------------
1. Trendelenburg is no longer believed to increase BP and / or cardiac output in most patients, does not improve tissue oxygenation, results in displacement of only a very small amount of total blood volume, and actually decreases cardiac output in the hypotensive patient. It has also been proven to produce right ventricular stress and deterioration of pulmonary function. 
2. GI bleeding may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock if it has been gradual. Ask patient about possible melena, hematemesis, and hematochezia.
3. Ectopic pregnancy may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock. Consider this diagnosis in all women of child bearing age if there is a complaint of abdominal, back or pelvic pain. 
4. Abdominal aneurysm may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock. Consider this diagnosis in patient’s whose age is ≥ 50, and who have a cardiac /
hypertensive history if there is a complaint of abdominal or back pain.
