Seizures Management
protocolid = 29
==============================
EMTI/EMTP
---------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>a.<td>Suction the oro / nasopharynx as necessary.
<tr><td>b.<td>Place a nasopharyngeal airway as necessary (avoid in head trauma).
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>4.<td>Do not restrain the patient. Let the seizure take its course but protect patient from injury.
<tr><td>5.<td>Perform rapid glucose determination. If glucose less than 60 mg / dL or clinical signs and symptoms indicate hypoglycemia, refer to the <i><u>Hypoglycemia protocol</u></i>.
<tr><td>6.<td>Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.
<tr><td>7.<td>If the seizure persists and the rapid glucose determination is greater than 60 mg / dL, give <i><u>MIDAZOLAM</u></i> 0.1 mg / kg IV / IM (max single dose 5 mg)
<tr><td>a.<td>Repeat dose in 5 minutes if seizure persists.
<tr><td>b.<td>If midazolam is unavailable, administer, <i><u>DIAZEPAM</u></i> 0.25 mg / kg up to 5 mg slow IV push. Repeat once as necessary.
<tr><td>8.<td>Place patient on cardiac monitor (life-threatening dysrhythmias may cause seizure-like activity).
<tr><td>9.<td>Consider placing the patient in the recovery position during the postictal period.
<tr><td>10.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
