Seizures Management

==============================

1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
a. Suction the oro / nasopharynx as necessary.
b. Place a nasopharyngeal airway as necessary
(avoid in head trauma).
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
4. Do not restrain the patient. Let the seizure take its
course but protect patient from injury.
5. Perform rapid glucose determination. If glucose less
than 60 mg / dL or clinical signs and symptoms indicate
hypoglycemia, refer to the Hypoglycemia protocol.
6. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.

7. If the seizure persists and the rapid glucose
determination is greater than 60 mg / dL, give
MIDAZOLAM 0.1 mg / kg IV / IM (max single dose 5 mg)
a. Repeat dose in 5 minutes if seizure persists.
b. If midazolam is unavailable, administer,
DIAZEPAM 0.25 mg / kg up to 5 mg slow IV
push. Repeat once as necessary.
8. Place patient on cardiac monitor (life-threatening
dysrhythmias may cause seizure-like activity).
9. Consider placing the patient in the recovery position
during the postictal period.
10. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
