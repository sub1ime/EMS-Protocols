Respiratory Distress
protocolid=28
====================================
EMTI/EMTP
------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>4.<td>Place patient in a position of comfort, typically sitting upright.
<tr><td>5.<td>Monitor <i><u>Capnography</u></i>, if available.
<tr><td>6.<td>Assist patient with prescribed BRONCHODILATOR METERED DOSE INHALER (MDI). If no dosing schedule is prescribed, repeat in 5 to 10 minutes as needed.
<tr><td>7.<td>If in critical respiratory distress, provide BVM ventilation with patient’s spontaneous efforts. If patient becomes unresponsive, perform BVM ventilation with an airway adjunct. If BVM ventilation is inadequate, secure airway with a definitive airway (Supraglottic / dual lumen) or ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE [Level I and P only].
<tr><td><td><b>For patients in respiratory distress:</b>
<tr><td>8.<td>Give <i><u>ALBUTEROL</u></i> 2.5 to 5.0 mg and <i><u>IPRATOPRIUM</u></i> 0.5 mg via small volume nebulizer.
<tr><td>a.<td>Nebulizer with mouthpiece or facemask.
<tr><td>b.<td>Repeat Albuterol every 10 minutes up to 4 treatments if respiratory distress persists and no contraindications develop. Note: Ipratropium bromide is only administered with the first treatment.
<tr><td>9.<td>Establish venous access as needed.
<tr><td>10.<td>Administer <i><u>PREDNISONE</u></i> 60 mg PO.
<tr><td>11.<td>Administer <i><u>CPAP</u></i> with 5 – 10 cm H 2 0 PEEP for moderate to severe dyspnea. For levels I and P, if the CPAP device allows, begin at 5.0 mmHg and titrate to effect.
<tr><td>12.<td>In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress that is non-responsive to standard medications, consider administration of <i><u>MAGNESIUM SULFATE</u></i> 40 mg / kg IV over 20 minutes (max dose of 2 grams).
<tr><td>13.<td><b>This Procedure Requires Medical Control</b>
In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress that is non-responsive to standard medications, contact Medical Control to consider administration of <i><u>EPINEPHRINE 1:1,000</u></i> 0.01 mg / kg up to 0.3 mg IM.
<tr><td>14.<td>Place on cardiac monitor and obtain <i><u>12 lead ECG</u></i> per assessment.
<tr><td>15.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
