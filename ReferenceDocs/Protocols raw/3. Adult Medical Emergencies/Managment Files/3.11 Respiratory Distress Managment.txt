1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
4. Place patient in a position of comfort, typically sitting
upright.
5. Monitor Capnography, if available.
9. Establish venous access as needed.
10. Administer PREDNISONE 60 mg PO.
6. Assist patient with prescribed BRONCHODILATOR
METERED DOSE INHALER (MDI). If no dosing
schedule is prescribed, repeat in 5 to 10 minutes as
needed.
7. If in critical respiratory distress, provide BVM ventilation
with patient’s spontaneous efforts. If patient becomes
unresponsive, perform BVM ventilation with an airway
adjunct. If BVM ventilation is inadequate, secure airway
with a definitive airway (Supraglottic / dual lumen) or
ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE [Level I and P only].
For patients in respiratory distress:
8. Give ALBUTEROL 2.5 to 5.0 mg and IPRATOPRIUM
0.5 mg via small volume nebulizer.
a. Nebulizer with mouthpiece or facemask.
b. Repeat Albuterol every 10 minutes up to 4
treatments if respiratory distress persists and no
contraindications develop. Note: Ipratropium
bromide is only administered with the first
treatment.

11. Administer CPAP with 5 – 10 cm H 2 0 PEEP for
moderate to severe dyspnea. For levels I and P, if the
CPAP device allows, begin at 5.0 mmHg and titrate to
effect.

12. In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress
that is non-responsive to standard medications, consider
administration of MAGNESIUM SULFATE 40 mg / kg IV
over 20 minutes (max dose of 2 grams).
13. In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress
that is non-responsive to standard medications, contact
Medical Control to consider administration of
EPINEPHRINE 1:1,000 0.01 mg / kg up to 0.3 mg IM.
14. Place on cardiac monitor and obtain 12 lead ECG per
assessment.
15. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
