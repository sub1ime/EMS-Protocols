Shock Managment

==================================
EMTP/EMTI/EMTEN
------------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Assess for signs of shock including, but not limited to:
• Restlessness, altered mental status, hypoperfusion (cool, pale, moist skin), tachypnea (rapid breathing), rapid, weak pulse, orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure suddenly drops on standing up), nausea and thirst.
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer oxygen per patient assessment to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> between 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>5.<td>Transport as soon as possible.
<tr><td>6.<td>Control external bleeding with direct pressure, then tourniquet if direct pressure is inadequate.
<tr><td>7.<td>If pregnant (uterine fundus above umbilicus), place the patient on her left side.
<tr><td>8.<td>Maintain body temperature by protecting the patient from the environment, removing wet clothing and covering the patient with a blanket.
<tr><td>9.<td>Establish a large bore IV or IO of Normal Saline. If time permits, establish second access.
• Do not delay transport to establish vascular access.
<tr><td>10.<td>Give a 20 mL / kg bolus. If no improvement after the first 20 mL / kg bolus, may repeat once. While administering a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> ), slow the IV to KVO.
<tr><td>11.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
