Shock Managment

==================================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Assess for signs of shock including, but not limited to:
• Restlessness, altered mental status, hypoperfusion
(cool, pale, moist skin), tachypnea (rapid breathing),
rapid, weak pulse, orthostatic hypotension (blood
pressure suddenly drops on standing up), nausea
and thirst.
4. Administer oxygen per patient assessment to maintain
SpO 2 between 94 - 99%. Support respirations as
necessary with a BVM.
5. Transport as soon as possible.
6. Control external bleeding with direct pressure, then
tourniquet if direct pressure is inadequate.
7. If pregnant (uterine fundus above umbilicus), place the
patient on her left side.
8. Maintain body temperature by protecting the patient from
the environment, removing wet clothing and covering the
patient with a blanket.
9. Establish a large bore IV or IO of Normal Saline. If time
permits, establish second access.
• Do not delay transport to establish vascular access.
10. Give a 20 mL / kg bolus. If no improvement after the first
20 mL / kg bolus, may repeat once. While administering
a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for
improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO
and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload
respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi,
decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
