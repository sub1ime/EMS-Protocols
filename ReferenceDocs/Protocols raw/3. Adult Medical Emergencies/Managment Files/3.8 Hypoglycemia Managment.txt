<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.

<tr><td>3.<td>Assess for signs of trauma. Provide spinal immobilization as necessary.
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%
<tr><td>5.<td>For altered mental status, perform rapid glucose determination.
<tr><td>6.<td>If glucose less than 60 mg / dL or clinical signs and symptoms indicate hypoglycemia and the patient is awake and able to swallow:
<tr><td>a.<td>If the patient can protect airway, give Oral Glucose 15 grams. Repeat in 15 minutes if necessary.

<tr><td>a.<td>Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.
<tr><td>b.<td>Patient > 2 years old: Give <i><u>DEXTROSE 50%</u></i> 1 g / kg up to 25 g IV. Repeat once in 2 minutes if altered mental status persists.
