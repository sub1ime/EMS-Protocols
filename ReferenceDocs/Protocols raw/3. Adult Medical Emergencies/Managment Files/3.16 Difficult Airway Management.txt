Difficult Airway

===========================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Assess mechanism of injury and / or nature of illness.
Protect C-spine if necessary.
3. Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
4. Assess patient ability to control airway and adequacy of
ventilations. Do not hypo or hyperventilate.
5. Use head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust as appropriate to open
airway. Use oral or nasal airway adjuncts to support as
appropriate.
6. Support ventilations with two man bag-valve-mask
ventilations if personnel is available.
7. If unable to maintain airway, consider oral (I or P) or
nasal (P only) intubation.
8. If unable to successfully intubate, attempt to use an
alternative airway to secure airway.
9. If still unable to maintain airway, consider medication
facilitated intubation* or use alternative airway as a
rescue device.
10. If still unable to maintain airway, consider surgical
airway.*
11. Transport promptly.
12. Continuously monitor patientâ€™s airway.
