EMTP
-----------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Assess mechanism of injury and / or nature of illness. Protect C-spine if necessary.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer Oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%
<tr><td>4.<td>Assess patient ability to control airway and adequacy of ventilations. Do not hypo or hyperventilate.
<tr><td>5.<td>Use head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust as appropriate to open airway. Use oral or nasal airway adjuncts to support as appropriate.
<tr><td>6.<td>Support ventilations with two man bag-valve-mask ventilations if personnel is available.
<tr><td>7.<td>If unable to maintain airway, consider oral (I or P) or nasal (P only) intubation.
<tr><td>8.<td>If unable to successfully intubate, attempt to use an <i><u>alternative airway</u></i> to secure airway.
<tr><td>9.<td>If still unable to maintain airway, consider medication facilitated intubation* or use alternative airway as a rescue device.
<tr><td>10.<td>If still unable to maintain airway, consider <i><u>surgical airway</u></i>.*
<tr><td>11.<td>Transport promptly.
<tr><td>12.<td>Continuously monitor patient’s airway.
