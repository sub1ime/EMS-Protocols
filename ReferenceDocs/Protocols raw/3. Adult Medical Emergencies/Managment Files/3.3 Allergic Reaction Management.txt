protocolId = 20
=================================

EMTA
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%
<tr><td>4.<td>If the patient is experiencing respiratory distress with wheezing, refer to the <i><u>Respiratory Distress protocol</u></i>.

EMTB
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%
<tr><td>4.<td>If the patient is experiencing respiratory distress with wheezing, refer to the <i><u>Respiratory Distress protocol</u></i>.
<tr><td>5.<td>Transport as soon as possible.
<tr><td>6.<td>If signs of anaphylaxis available, administer epinephrine via an EpiPen &#174; / EpiPen Jr. &#174; autoinjector.
<tr><td>7.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.

EMTEN
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer <u><i>DIPHENHYDRAMINE</i></u> 1 mg / kg up to 50 mg IM or IV. The IV route is preferred for the patient in severe shock. If an IV cannot be readily established, give diphenhydramine via the IM route.
<tr><td>5.<td>If the patient is experiencing respiratory distress with wheezing, refer to the <i><u>Respiratory Distress protocol</u></i>.
<tr><td>6.<td>Transport as soon as possible.
<tr><td>7.<td>If signs of anaphylaxis available, administer epinephrine via an EpiPen &#174; / EpiPen Jr. &#174; autoinjector.
<tr><td>8.<td>If signs of anaphylaxis and EpiPen &#174; / EpiPen Jr. &#174; have not been administered, administer <u>EPINEPHERINE 1:1,000</u> 0.01 mg / kg up to 0.3 mg IM. <b>Call Medical Control prior to administration in patients with Coronary Artery Disease history and / or ≥ 50 years of age</b>.
<tr><td>9.<td>Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.
<tr><td>10.<td>If hypoperfusion persists following the first dose of epinephrine, consider administration of 20 mL / kg normal saline IV. While administering a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub>), slow the IV to KVO.
<tr><td>11.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
