Dystonic / Extrapyramidal Reactions
====================================

Overview
-------------
Dystonic or extra-pyramidal reactions are characterized by an unusual posture, change in muscle tone, drooling, and / or uncontrolled movements. Although dystonic reactions are occasionally dose related these reactions are more often idiosyncratic and not predictable. Dystonia results from drug-induced alteration of the dopaminergic-cholinergic balance in the basal ganglia. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, family history of dystonia, recent history of cocaine or alcohol use, or treatment with a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist such as fluphenazine and almost every anti-psychotic medication. Diphenhydramine, when administered, usually causes marked improvement, if not total resolution of symptoms.

PEARLS
------------------------------
1. Incidence of acute dystonic reactions vary according to individual susceptibility, drug identity, dose, and duration of therapy.
2. A small population of all patients on neuroleptic medications have dystonic reactions.
3. In rare instances, although abnormal, airway management may be needed.
4. Dystonic reactions are rarely life threatening and result in no long term effects.
5. Risk of reaction typically decreases with age and tends to be most common in children, teens, and young adults (< 45 years old).
