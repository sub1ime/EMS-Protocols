Behavioral Emergencies
======================

OverView
-----------
Psychiatric patients may have an illness that presents with symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, depression, or significant trauma. The patient’s symptoms demand immediate response as they may appear intense, raise the anxiety levels of those around the patient to an intolerable level, or create problems in the immediate environment. The patient may perceive their life to be at immediate risk, either from suicide or their current inability to make logical decisions. Remember that <b>personal safety takes priority over patient intervention</b>. Patient care should be focused with preventing / mitigating hyperthermia, agitated delirium, positional asphyxia, hypoxia, and physical harm.

PEARLS
------------------
1. Do not leave patient alone once patient contact has been made unless your safety has been compromised. Your safety is the primary concern. If necessary, leave equipment on scene.
2. Every suicide act, gesture, or verbal threat must be taken seriously. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, patients are unable to refuse care under these circumstances and shall be placed in emergency custody as needed with police assistance, <u>VA Code 37.2-808</u>.
3. Always have police search patient for weapons or items that could be used as weapons prior to placing patient in ambulance. Patient belongings that are secured should be transported in the front of the ambulance, or an outside compartment, for safety and given to hospital staff on arrival.
4. If a patient must be transported using handcuffs or police flexible wrist restraints, a police officer should ride in the ambulance with the patient to the receiving hospital.
