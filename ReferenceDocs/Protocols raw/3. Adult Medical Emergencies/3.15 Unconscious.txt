Unconscious / Syncope / AMS
===========================================

OVERVIEW:
----------------------------------
The unconscious patient can be a difficult patient to manage. There are many potential causes for a change in mentation or syncope. These causes range from benign problems to potentially life-threatening cardiopulmonary or central nervous system disorders. When approaching the patient that has experienced a change in mental status, or syncope, be alert for clues that may indicate the potential cause – diligently obtain a thorough patient history and perform a complete physical exam. Obtaining an adequate physical assessment and assessing for the presence of common causes of the episode can quickly aid you in determining the proper sequence of care to provide to the patient. Focus on managing any life-threatening conditions that may have led to the episode and correcting any found.

HPI
-------------------------
• Cardiac history, stroke, seizures
• Occult blood loss (GI, ectopic)
• Females (LMP, vaginal bleeding)
• Fluid loss (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
• Past medical history
• Recent trauma
• Complaint prior to event

Signs and Symptoms
-------------------------
• Loss of consciousness with recovery
• Lightheadedness, dizziness
• Palpitations, slow or rapid pulse
• Pulse irregularity
• Decreased blood pressure

Considerations
----------------------
• Vasovagal
• Orthostatic hypotension
• Cardiac syncope / dysrhythmia
• Micturation / defecation syncope
• Psychiatric
• Stroke
• Hypoglycemia
• Seizure
• Shock
• GI Bleed
• Ectopic Pregnancy

PEARLS:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. In patient that has experienced a syncopal episode, assess for signs or symptoms of injury and take appropriate precautions if there is reason to suspect trauma, or traumatic injury that cannot be ruled out.
2. In patients with a cardiac history, or in the elderly, be suspicious of cardiac arrhythmia as the cause of syncope.
