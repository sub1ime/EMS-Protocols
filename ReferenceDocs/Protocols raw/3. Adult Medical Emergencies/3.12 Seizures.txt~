Seizures
===================================

OVERVIEW:
-----------------------
A seizure is a period of altered neurologic function caused by abnormal neuronal electrical discharges. Generalized seizures begin with an abrupt loss of consciousness. If motor activity is present, it symmetrically involves all four extremities. Episodes that develop over minutes to hours are less likely to be seizures; generally seizures only last one to two minutes. Patients with seizure disorders tend to have stereotype, or similar, seizures with each episode and are less likely to have inconsistent or highly variable attacks. True seizures are usually not provoked by emotional stress. Most seizures are followed by a postictal state of lethargy and confusion.

Signs and Symptoms
--------------------
• Decreased mental status
• Sleepiness
• Incontinence
• Observed seizure activity
• Evidence of trauma

Considerations
----------------
• CNS (head) trauma
• Brain tumor
• Metabolic, hepatic, renal failure
• Diabetic
• Hypoxia
• Electrolyte abnormality
• Drugs, medications, non-compliance
• Infection, fever, meningitis
• Alcohol withdrawal
• Eclampsia
• Stroke
• Hyperthermia


Management
-------------------------------------------
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
a. Suction the oro / nasopharynx as necessary.
b. Place a nasopharyngeal airway as necessary
(avoid in head trauma).
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
4. Do not restrain the patient. Let the seizure take its
course but protect patient from injury.
5. Perform rapid glucose determination. If glucose less
than 60 mg / dL or clinical signs and symptoms indicate
hypoglycemia, refer to the Hypoglycemia protocol.
6. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.

SEIZURES

7. If the seizure persists and the rapid glucose
determination is greater than 60 mg / dL, give
MIDAZOLAM 0.1 mg / kg IV / IM (max single dose 5 mg)
a. Repeat dose in 5 minutes if seizure persists.
b. If midazolam is unavailable, administer,
DIAZEPAM 0.25 mg / kg up to 5 mg slow IV
push. Repeat once as necessary.
8. Place patient on cardiac monitor (life-threatening
dysrhythmias may cause seizure-like activity).
9. Consider placing the patient in the recovery position
during the postictal period.
10. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.

PEARLS:
1.
Status epilepticus is defined as two or more consecutive seizures without a
period of consciousness or recovery. This is a true emergency requiring rapid
airway control, treatment, and transport.
2.
Grand Mal seizures are generalized in nature and associated with loss of
consciousness, incontinence, and tongue trauma.
3.
Focal seizures affect only a specific part of the body and are not usually
associated with loss of consciousness.
4.
Jacksonian seizures are seizures that start as focal in nature and become
generalized.
5.
Petit Mal seizures may be localized to a single muscle group or may not involve
visible seizure activity at all. Always examine pupils for nystagmus, which would
alert provider to continued seizure activity.
6.
Respirations during an active seizure should be considered ineffective and
airway maintenance should occur per assessment.
7.
Be prepared for airway problems and continued seizures.
8.
Investigate possibility of trauma and substance abuse.
9.
Be prepared to assist ventilations as dosage Midazolam or Valium is repeated
and / or increased.
