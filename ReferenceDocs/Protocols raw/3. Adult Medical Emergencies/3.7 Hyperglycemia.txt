Hyperglycemia
=====================================

Overview
---------------------------------
Symptomatic hyperglycemia can be described as an elevated blood glucose level with signs of severe dehydration, altered mental status, and / or shock. For the purpose of these protocols, the glucose level for symptomatic hyperglycemia is 300 mg / dL. Hyperglycemia is usually the result of an inadequate supply of insulin to meet the body’s needs. Most pre-hospital care should be focused around the treatment of severe dehydration and support of vital functions.

PEARLS
---------------------
1. Use aseptic techniques to draw blood from finger.
2. Allow alcohol to dry completely prior to puncturing finger for blood glucose level. Alcohol may cause inaccurate readings. Do not blow on, or fan site, to dry faster.
3. After puncturing finger, use only moderate pressure to obtain blood. Excessive pressure may cause rupture of cells causing inaccurate results.
4. Know your specific agency’s glucometer’s parameters for a “HI” and “LO” reading.
