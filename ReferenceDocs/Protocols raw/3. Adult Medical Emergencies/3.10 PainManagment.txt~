Pain Management
====================

OVERVIEW:
----------------------------
The practice of pre-hospital emergency medicine requires expertise in a wide variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques to treat acute pain resulting from a myriad of injuries and illness. One of the most essential missions for all healthcare providers should be the relief and / or prevention of pain and suffering. Approaches to pain relief must be designed to be safe and effective in the organized chaos of the prehospital environment. The degree of pain and the hemodynamic status of the patient will determine the rapidity of care.

HPI
---------------------
• Age
• Location
• Duration
• Severity (1 - 10)
• Past medical history
• Medications
• Drug allergies

Signs and Symptoms
------------------------
• Severity (pain scale)
• Quality (sharp, dull, etc)
• Radiation
• Relation to movement, respiration
• Increased with palpation of area

Considerations
--------------------------------
• Musculoskeletal
• Visceral (abdominal)
• Cardiac
• Pleural, respiratory
• Neurogenic
• Renal (colic)

Management
---------------------------------------
Perform general patient management.
Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
Determine patient’s pain score assessment.
Place patient on cardiac monitor per patient
assessment.
Establish IV of normal saline per patient assessment.
If significant pain, administer FENTANYL 1 mcg / kg
IV, or IM (max single dose of 50 mcg). Sickle cell
patients may be given higher doses up to 100 mcg
IV, or IM.
*** IV Fentanyl MUST be administered slowly to
decrease the risk of chest rigidity***
If Fentanyl unavailable, administer MORPHINE
SULPHATE 0.1 mg / kg IV or IM (max single dose of
5.0 mg). Sickle cell patients may be given higher
doses up to 10 mg IV or IM.
Repeat the patient’s pain score assessment.
If indicated based on pain assessment, repeat pain
medication administration after 10 minutes of the
previous dose. Maximum total dose of Fentanyl is
200 mcg and Morphine Sulphate is 20 mg for non
sickle cell patients. Sickle cell patients may have up
to a total of 400 mcg of Fentanyl or 40 mg of
Morphine Sulphate.

indicated.

PEARLS:
1.
Pain severity (0 - 10) is a vital sign that should be recorded before and after IV or
IM medication administration and upon arrival at destination.
2.
Contraindications to narcotic medication administration include hypotension,
head injury, respiratory depression, and severe COPD.
3.
All patients should have drug allergies ascertained prior to administration of pain
medication.
4.
Patients receiving narcotic analgesics should be administered oxygen.
5.
Narcotic analgesia was historically contraindicated in the pre-hospital setting for
abdominal pain of unknown etiology. It was thought that analgesia would hinder
the ER physician or surgeon’s evaluation. Recent studies have demonstrated
Opiate administration may alter the physical examination findings, but these
changes result in no significant increase in management errors. 1

Fentanyl is contraindicated for patients who have taken MAOIs within past 14
days, and used with caution in patients with head injuries, increased ICP, COPD,
and liver or kidney dysfunction.
