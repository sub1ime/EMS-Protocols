Difficult Airway
===============================

OVERVIEW:
-------------------------
The purpose of these guidelines is to facilitate the management of the difficult airway and to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes. The principal adverse out comes associated with the difficult airway include, but are not limited to, death, brain injury, myocardial injury, and airway trauma.

HPI
---------------------------
• Age
• Past medical, surgical history
• Medications
• Reason for airway failure
• Duration of symptoms
• Last meal
• Menstrual history, pregnancy

Signs and Symptoms
------------------------
• Hypercarbia
• Stridor
• Trismus
• Pooling of secretions
• Hypoxia

Considerations
-------------------------
• Congentital abnormalities
• Previous Tracheostomy
• Previous neck surgeries
• Previous mouth / throat surgeries
• Known head / neck cancers and masses
• Trauma

Note
--------------------------
<b>*Medication Facilitated Intubation and Surgical Airway are skills that are only approved when:</b>

• Proper medications and equipment are available for procedures; AND

• The ALS Provider has been trained in those procedures; AND

• The provider’s OMD has authorized the performance of the procedures for the provider.

Managment
----------------------------------
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Assess mechanism of injury and / or nature of illness.
Protect C-spine if necessary.
3. Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
4. Assess patient ability to control airway and adequacy of
ventilations. Do not hypo or hyperventilate.
5. Use head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust as appropriate to open
airway. Use oral or nasal airway adjuncts to support as
appropriate.
6. Support ventilations with two man bag-valve-mask
ventilations if personnel is available.
7. If unable to maintain airway, consider oral (I or P) or
nasal (P only) intubation.
8. If unable to successfully intubate, attempt to use an
alternative airway to secure airway.
9. If still unable to maintain airway, consider medication
facilitated intubation* or use alternative airway as a
rescue device.
10. If still unable to maintain airway, consider surgical
airway.*
11. Transport promptly.
12. Continuously monitor patient’s airway.
