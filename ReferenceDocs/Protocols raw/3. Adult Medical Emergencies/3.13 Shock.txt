Shock
================================

OVERVIEW:
--------------------------------
Shock is defined as a state of inadequate tissue perfusion. This may result in acidosis, derangements of cellular metabolism, potential end-organ damage, and death. Early in the shock process, patients are able to compensate for decreased perfusion by increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to tachycardia and tachypnea. Later, compensatory mechanisms fail, causing a decreased mental status, hypotension, and death. Early cellular injury may be reversible if definitive therapy is delivered promptly.

HPI
----------------------
• Blood loss (vaginal or gastrointestinal)
• AAA, ectopic
• Fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhea)
• Fever
• Infection
• Cardiac ischemia (MI, HF)
• Medications
• Allergic Reaction
• Pregnancy

Signs and Symptoms
-----------------------------------
• Restlessness, confusion
• Weakness, dizziness
• Weak, rapid pulse
• Pale, cool, clammy skin
• Delayed capillary refill
• Hypotension
• Coffee-ground emesis
• Tarry stools

Considerations
--------------------------
• Shock
   o Hypovolemic
   o Cardiogenic
   o Septic
   o Neurogenic
   o Anaphylactic
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Dysrhythmia
• Pulmonary embolus
• Tension pneumothorax
• Medication effect, overdose
• Vaso-vagal
• Physiologic (pregnancy)

Classes of Shock
---------------------------------
<b>Hypovolemic</b>
Caused by hemorrhage, burns, or dehydration.

<b>Distributive</b>
Maldistribution of  blood, caused by poor vasomotor tone in neurogenic shock, sepsis, anaphylaxis, severe hypoxia, or metabolic shock.

<b>Cardiogenic</b>
Caused by necrosis of the myocardial tissue, or by arrhythmias.

<b>Obstructive</b>
Caused by impairment of cardiac filling, found in pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, or cardiac Tamponade.

PEARLS:
----------------------------------------
1. Trendelenburg is no longer believed to increase BP and / or cardiac output in most patients, does not improve tissue oxygenation, results in displacement of only a very small amount of total blood volume, and actually decreases cardiac output in the hypotensive patient. It has also been proven to produce right ventricular stress and deterioration of pulmonary function. 
2. GI bleeding may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock if it has been gradual. Ask patient about possible melena, hematemesis, and hematochezia.
3. Ectopic pregnancy may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock. Consider this diagnosis in all women of child bearing age if there is a complaint of abdominal, back or pelvic pain. 
4. Abdominal aneurysm may be a less obvious cause of hypovolemic shock. Consider this diagnosis in patient’s whose age is ≥ 50, and who have a cardiac /
hypertensive history if there is a complaint of abdominal or back pain.
