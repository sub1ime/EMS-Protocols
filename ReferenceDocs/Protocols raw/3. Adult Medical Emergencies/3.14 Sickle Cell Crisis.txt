Sickle Cell Anemia / Crisis
=======================================

OVERVIEW:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sickle cell anemia is a recessive genetic illness that primarily affects African-Americans, but also people with African, Arab, India, Greek, Italian, and Latin American heritage. Although rare, Caucasians can also have sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait. In patients with sickle cell anemia, the beta hemoglobin chain of red blood cells are produced abnormally, hemoglobin S, which has an inferior oxygen-carrying ability. These mutated molecules do not have the smooth motion needed for oxygenation and de-oxygenation. When these hemoglobin S cells are exposed to low-oxygen states, they crystallize, distorting the RBC into a fragile, stiff and rigid crescent (sickle) shape, stopping the smooth passage of the cell through the narrow blood vessels. As a result, blood vessels can sometimes become clogged causing occlusions within the vessels. As fewer RBCs pass through congested vessels, tissues and joints receive less oxygen, causing excruciating pain from the buildup of waste products in the hypoxic areas. Pain may range from mild transient attacks with duration of minutes to severe pain lasting days to weeks and requiring hospitalization.

PEARLS:
------------------------------------
1. Oxygen should be administered if necessary to maintain an O<sub>2</sub> saturation above 94% to sickle cell patients to fully oxygenate all normal RBCs and to decrease the sickling of RBCs that occurs during hypoxic states.
2. Several factors causing sickle cell crises include an infection such as a cold or the flu, cold weather, fatigue, over exercising, and dehydration.
3. Symptoms of sickle cell disease may start in children as young as six months old. Babies suffering from sickle cell symptoms may be irritable or cranky and cry even when their parents do everything they can to comfort them. A thorough assessment may include determining the parent’s history when dispatched to a patient complaining of these vague symptoms.
4. Sickle cell disease is inherited. A patient must inherit two sickle cell genes, one from each parent, to develop sickle cell disease. When only one gene is present, the condition is known as a sickle cell trait. Patients with sickle cell trait often do not have crises.
