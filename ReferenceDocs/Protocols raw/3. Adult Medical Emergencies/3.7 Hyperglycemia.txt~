Hyperglycemia
=====================================

Overview
---------------------------------
Symptomatic hyperglycemia can be described as an elevated blood glucose level with signs of severe dehydration, altered mental status, and / or shock. For the purpose of these protocols, the glucose level for symptomatic hyperglycemia is 300 mg / dL. Hyperglycemia is usually the result of an inadequate supply of insulin to meet the body’s needs. Most pre-hospital care should be focused around the treatment of severe dehydration and support of vital functions.
