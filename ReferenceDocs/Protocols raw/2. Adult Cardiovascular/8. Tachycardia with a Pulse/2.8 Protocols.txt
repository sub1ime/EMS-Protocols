Tachycardia with a pulse
protocolId = 16
-------------------------------------------

Overview
--
Tachycardia’s can be classified in several ways, based on the appearance of the QRS complex, heart rate, and regularity. ACLS professionals should be able to recognize and differentiate between sinus tachycardia, narrow-complex SupraVentricular Tachycardia (SVT), and wide-complex tachycardia. Because ACLS providers may be unable to distinguish between supraventricular and ventricular rhythms, they should be aware that most wide-complex (broad-complex) tachycardias are ventricular in origin.


HPI
--
/b Past medical history Medications: (Aminophylline, Diet Pills, Thyroid Supplements, Decongestants, Digoxin)
/b Diet (caffeine, chocolate)
/b Drugs (nicotine, cocaine)
/b History of palpitations / heart racing
/b Syncope / near syncope

Signs and Symptoms
--
/b Heart rate > 150 bpm
/b Dizziness
/b Chest Pain
/b Shortness of Breath
/b Potential presenting rhythm:
 o Sinus tachycardia
 o Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter
 o Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)


Considerations
--
<b><u>QRS < 0.12 ms</u></b>
/b Sinus tachycardia
/b Atrial fibrillation
/b Atrial flutter
/b AV nodal reentry
/b Accessory pathway – mediated tachycardia
/b Atrial tachycardia (including automatic and reentry forms)
/b Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)
/b Junctional tachycardia (rare in adults)

<b><u>QRS > 0.12 ms</u></b>
/b Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation(VF)
/b SVT with aberrancy
/b Pre-excitation tachycardia’s (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome)
/b Ventricular paced rhythms
