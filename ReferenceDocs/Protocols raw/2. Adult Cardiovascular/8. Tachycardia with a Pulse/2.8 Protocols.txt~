Tachycardia with a pulse
protocolId = 16
-------------------------------------------

Overview
--
Tachycardiaâ€™s can be classified in several ways, based on the appearance of the QRS complex, heart rate, and regularity. ACLS professionals should be able to recognize and differentiate between sinus tachycardia, narrow-complex SupraVentricular Tachycardia (SVT), and wide-complex tachycardia. Because ACLS providers may be unable to distinguish between supraventricular and ventricular rhythms, they should be aware that most wide-complex (broad-complex) tachycardias are ventricular in origin.
