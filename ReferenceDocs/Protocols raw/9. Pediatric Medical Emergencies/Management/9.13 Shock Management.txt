<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Assess for signs of shock including, but not limited to:
• Restlessness, altered mental status, hypoperfusion (cool, pale, moist skin), tachypnea (rapid breathing), rapid, weak pulse, orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure suddenly drops on standing up), nausea and thirst.
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>5.<td>Transport as soon as possible.
<tr><td>6.<td>Control external bleeding with direct pressure, then <i><u>tourniquet</u></i> if direct pressure is inadequate.
<tr><td>7.<td>Establish a large bore IV or IO of Normal Saline. If time permits, establish second access.
• Do not delay transport to establish vascular access
<tr><td>8.<td>Maintain systolic BP appropriate for patient:
<tr><td>a.<td>Birth to 1 month - 60 mmHg
<tr><td>b.<td>1 month to 1 year - > 70 mmHg
<tr><td>c.<td>Greater than 1 year - 70 + [2 x Age (years)]
<tr><td>9.<td>Give a 20 mL / kg bolus. If no improvement after first 20 mL / kg bolus, may repeat once. While administering a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> ), slow the IV to KVO.
<tr><td>10.<td>Place the patient on the cardiac monitor.
<tr><td>11.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
