Shock - peds

================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Assess for signs of shock including, but not limited to:
• Restlessness, altered mental status, hypoperfusion
(cool, pale, moist skin), tachypnea (rapid breathing),
rapid, weak pulse, orthostatic hypotension (blood
pressure suddenly drops on standing up), nausea
and thirst.
4. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
5. Transport as soon as possible.
6. Control external bleeding with direct pressure, then
tourniquet if direct pressure is inadequate.
7. Establish a large bore IV or IO of Normal Saline. If time
permits, establish second access.
• Do not delay transport to establish vascular access
8. Maintain systolic BP appropriate for patient:
a. Birth to 1 month - 60 mmHg
b. 1 month to 1 year - > 70 mmHg
c. Greater than 1 year - 70 + [2 x Age (years)]
9. Give a 20 mL / kg bolus. If no improvement after first 20
mL / kg bolus, may repeat once. While administering a
fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for
improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to KVO
and monitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload
respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi,
decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
10. Place the patient on the cardiac monitor.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
