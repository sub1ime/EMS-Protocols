Foreign Body Aspiration

===============================
FBAO – CONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≥ 1 YEAR OF AGE
---------------------------------------------------
1. For the suspected conscious choking victim, quickly ask,
“Are you choking?” If the victim indicates “yes” by
nodding his head without speaking, this will verify that
the victim has severe airway obstruction.
a. Note: If the patient has a mild obstruction and is
coughing forcefully; do not interfere with the
patient’s spontaneous coughing / breathing effort.
2. Apply abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) in rapid
sequence until the obstruction is relieved.
a. If the choking patient is obese and the rescuer cannot encircle the patient’s abdomen, use chest
thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.
b. If the choking patient is in the late stages of
pregnancy, use chest thrusts instead of
abdominal thrusts.
3. If the patient becomes unresponsive, carefully support
the patient to the ground and follow the FBAO –
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT GREATER THAN OR
EQUAL TO 1 YEAR OF AGE protocol.
4. Transport and perform ongoing assessment.

FBAO – CONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≤ 1 YEAR OF AGE
--------------------------------------------------
1. Assess the patient to determine the extent of the
obstruction. When the airway obstruction is mild, the
infant can cough and make some sounds. When the
airway obstruction is severe, the infant cannot cough or
make any sound.
2. If FBAO is mild, do not interfere. Allow the victim to clear
the airway by coughing while you observe for signs of
severe FBAO.
3. If the FBAO is severe (i.e., the victim is unable to make a
sound), deliver 5 back blows (slaps) followed by 5 chest
thrusts.
4. If the patient becomes unresponsive, follow the FBAO –
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT LESS THAN 1 YEAR OF
AGE protocol.
5. Transport and perform ongoing assessment.

FBAO -- UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≥ 1 YEAR OF AGE
-----------------------------------------------------
1. If the patient was previously conscious with an airway
obstruction, carefully support the patient to the ground.

2. Use head-tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust (suspected trauma) to
open airway. Look for an object in the patient’s mouth.
Use a finger sweep only when you can see solid material
obstructing the airway.

3. Assess the patient’s breathing.

4. If respirations are absent, deliver 2 breaths. If chest rise
is not detected, reposition the airway, make a better
mask seal and try again.
5. If unable to deliver rescue breaths, start CPR.
6. Each time the airway is opened during CPR, look for an
object and remove if found with a finger sweep.

7. If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers, attempt
direct visualization of the airway via laryngoscopy. If the
obstruction is visualized, use forceps to remove the
obstruction.
8. If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers or
laryngoscopy, perform a cricothyrotomy. For children
younger than 12, a needle cricothyrotomy with
percutaneous transtracheal (jet) ventilation is the
surgical airway of choice.
9. Transport and perform ongoing assessment.

FBAO -- UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≤ 1 YEAR OF AGE
----------------------------------------------------
1. If the patient was previously conscious with an airway
obstruction, carefully position the patient for CPR.
2. Use head-tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust (suspected trauma) to
open airway. Look for an object in the patient’s mouth.
Use a finger sweep only when you can see solid material
obstructing the airway.
3. Assess the patient’s breathing.
4. If respirations are absent, deliver 2 breaths. If chest rise
and fall is not detected, reposition the airway, make a
better mask seal and try again.
5. If unable to deliver rescue breaths, start CPR.
6. Each time the airway is opened during CPR, look for an
object and remove if found with a finger sweep.
7. If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers, attempt
direct visualization of the airway via laryngoscopy If the
obstruction is visualized, use forceps to remove the
obstruction.
8. Transport and perform ongoing assessment.
