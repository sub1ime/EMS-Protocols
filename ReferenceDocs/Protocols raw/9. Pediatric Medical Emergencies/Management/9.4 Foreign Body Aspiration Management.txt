<table><tr><td><td><b>FBAO – CONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≥ 1 YEAR OF AGE</b>
<tr><td>1.<td>For the suspected conscious choking victim, quickly ask, “Are you choking?” If the victim indicates “yes” by nodding his head without speaking, this will verify that the victim has severe airway obstruction.
<tr><td>a.<td>Note: If the patient has a mild obstruction and is coughing forcefully; do not interfere with the patient’s spontaneous coughing / breathing effort.
<tr><td>2.<td>Apply abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved.
<tr><td>a.<td>If the choking patient is obese and the rescuer cannot encircle the patient’s abdomen, use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.
<tr><td>b.<td>If the choking patient is in the late stages of pregnancy, use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.
<tr><td>3.<td>If the patient becomes unresponsive, carefully support the patient to the ground and follow the FBAO – UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1 YEAR OF AGE protocol.
<tr><td>4.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment.
<tr><td><td>
<tr><td><td><b>FBAO – CONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≤ 1 YEAR OF AGE</b>
<tr><td>1.<td>Assess the patient to determine the extent of the obstruction. When the airway obstruction is mild, the infant can cough and make some sounds. When the airway obstruction is severe, the infant cannot cough or make any sound.
<tr><td>2.<td>If FBAO is mild, do not interfere. Allow the victim to clear the airway by coughing while you observe for signs of severe FBAO.
<tr><td>3.<td>If the FBAO is severe (i.e., the victim is unable to make a sound), deliver 5 back blows (slaps) followed by 5 chest thrusts.
<tr><td>4.<td>If the patient becomes unresponsive, follow the FBAO – UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT LESS THAN 1 YEAR OF AGE protocol.
<tr><td>5.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment.
<tr><td><td>
<tr><td><td><b>FBAO -- UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≥ 1 YEAR OF AGE</b>
<tr><td>1.<td>If the patient was previously conscious with an airway obstruction, carefully support the patient to the ground.
<tr><td>2.<td>Use head-tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust (suspected trauma) to open airway. Look for an object in the patient’s mouth. Use a finger sweep only when you can see solid material obstructing the airway.
<tr><td>3.<td>Assess the patient’s breathing.
<tr><td>4.<td>If respirations are absent, deliver 2 breaths. If chest rise is not detected, reposition the airway, make a better mask seal and try again.
<tr><td>5.<td>If unable to deliver rescue breaths, start CPR.
<tr><td>6.<td>Each time the airway is opened during CPR, look for an object and remove if found with a finger sweep.
<tr><td>7.<td>If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers, attempt direct visualization of the airway via laryngoscopy. If the obstruction is visualized, use forceps to remove the obstruction.
<tr><td>8.<td>If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers or laryngoscopy, perform a <i><u>cricothyrotomy</u></i>. For children younger than 12, a needle cricothyrotomy with percutaneous transtracheal (jet) ventilation is the surgical airway of choice.
<tr><td>9.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment.

<tr><td><td><b>FBAO -- UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT: ≤ 1 YEAR OF AGE</b>
<tr><td>1.<td>If the patient was previously conscious with an airway obstruction, carefully position the patient for CPR.
<tr><td>2.<td>Use head-tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust (suspected trauma) to open airway. Look for an object in the patient’s mouth. Use a finger sweep only when you can see solid material obstructing the airway.
<tr><td>3.<td>Assess the patient’s breathing.
<tr><td>4.<td>If respirations are absent, deliver 2 breaths. If chest rise and fall is not detected, reposition the airway, make a better mask seal and try again.
<tr><td>5.<td>If unable to deliver rescue breaths, start CPR.
<tr><td>6.<td>Each time the airway is opened during CPR, look for an object and remove if found with a finger sweep.
<tr><td>7.<td>If the FBAO is not relieved by BLS maneuvers, attempt direct visualization of the airway via laryngoscopy If the obstruction is visualized, use forceps to remove the obstruction.
