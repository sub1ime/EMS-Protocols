Allergic Reaction - Peds

=============================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
4. Administer DIPHENHYDRAMINE 1 mg / kg up to 50 mg
IM or IV. The IV route is preferred for the patient in
severe shock. If an IV cannot be readily established,
give diphenhydramine via the IM route.
5. If the patient is experiencing respiratory distress with
wheezing, refer to the Respiratory Distress protocol.
6. Transport as soon as possible.
7. For severe symptoms such as airway compromise,
severe respiratory distress, or hypotension:
a. If available, administer epinephrine via an
EpiPen or EpiPen Jr. Autoinjector.
b. If EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr. is unavailable; give
EPINEPHERINE 1:1,000 0.01 mg / kg up to
0.3 mg IM. Call Medical Control if no
improvement.

8. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO. Titrate to a
systolic pressure appropriate for child:
a.
Birth to 1 month - 60 mmHg
b.
1 month to 1 year - > 70 mmHg
c.
Greater than 1 year – 70 + [2 x Age (years)]
9. If hypoperfusion persists following the first dose of
epinephrine, consider administration of 20mL/kg normal
saline IV. While administering a fluid bolus, frequently
reassess perfusion for improvement. If perfusion
improves, slow the IV to KVO and monitor closely. If
patient develops fluid overload respiratory distress
(dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the
IV to KVO.
10. Administer PREDNISONE 1 - 2 mg / kg up to 60 mg PO
if patient is > 3 years old and can swallow pills.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
