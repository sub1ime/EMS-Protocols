Respiratory Distress - Peds

==================================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
4. Place patient in a position of comfort, typically sitting
upright.
5. Monitor Capnography, if available.
6. Assist patient with prescribed METERED DOSE
INHALER (MDI). If no dosing schedule is prescribed,
repeat in 5 to 10 minutes as needed.
7. If in critical respiratory distress, provide BVM ventilation
with patient’s spontaneous efforts. If patient becomes
unresponsive, perform BVM ventilation with an airway
adjunct. If BVM ventilation is inadequate, secure airway
with an alternative airway or endotracheal tube
[P only].

For patients in respiratory distress:
8. Give ALBUTEROL 2.5 to 5.0 mg and IPRATROPIUM
0.5 mg via small volume nebulizer.
a. Greater than or equal to 4 years of age – nebulizer
with mouthpiece or facemask.
b. Repeat Albuterol every 10 minutes up to 4
treatments if respiratory distress persists and no
contraindications develop. Note: Ipratropium
bromide is only administered with the 1st treatment.
9. Start an IV of normal saline.
10. If older than 3 years old and can swallow pills,
administer PREDNISONE 1 – 2 mg / kg up to 60 mg PO.
11. Administer CPAP with 5 - 10 cm H 2 0 PEEP for moderate
to severe dyspnea.
12. In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress
that is non-responsive to standard medications, consider
administration of MAGNESIUM SULFATE 40 mg / kg IV
over 20 minutes (max dose of 2 grams).
13. In the asthmatic patient, for severe respiratory distress
that is non-responsive to standard medications, consult
Medical Control to consider administration of
EPINEPHRINE 1:1,000 0.01 mg / kg up to 0.3 mg IM.
14. Place on cardiac monitor and obtain 12 lead ECG per
assessment.
15. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
