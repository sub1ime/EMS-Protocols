Nausea and Vomiting
=====================
OVERVIEW:
----------------
The pre-hospital provider should be very careful to insure that patients who present with vague complaints such as nausea and vomiting are thoroughly evaluated. The patient’s symptoms and recent history must determine the most appropriate care. Frequently, treatment of an underlying cause and limiting movement may resolve or greatly reduce these complaints. However, persistent nausea and vomiting of unknown etiology may respond well to pharmaceutical therapy. All patients presenting with nausea and vomiting should be screened for potential life-threats initially. Anti-emetic treatment should occur only as a secondary priority.

PEARLS:
--------------
1. Nausea and vomiting has many subtle, sometimes life threatening causes. Do not minimize its importance as a symptom.
2. Ondansetron may not be as effective for vertigo and labyrinthitis related nausea and vomiting.
3. For nausea and vomiting associated with dehydration, fluid replenishment may be sufficient in improving patient comfort and reduce the need for medication administration.
4. Ensuring that you have reasonably addressed possible causes, will help minimize the potential that you are overlooking a life-threat and / or concern that should receive priority over anti-emetic treatment.
5. In cases of toxic ingestion, including alcohol, poisons, and drug overdoses, vomiting is an internal protective mechanism and should not be prevented with pharmacological therapy in the pre-hospital environment. Care should be given to prevent aspiration.
6. Ondansetron is also safe and effective for nausea and vomiting in trauma patients and can be used in conjunction with pain management.
7. Proper documentation should include the mental status and vital signs before and after medication administration.
