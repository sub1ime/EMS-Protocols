Hyperglycemia
===================
OVERVIEW:
----------------
Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder of childhood, affecting approximately 2 / 1,000 school-age children in the United States. Symptomatic hyperglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level > 300 mg/dl with signs of severe dehydration, altered mental status, and/ or shock. Hyperglycemia is usually the result of an inadequate supply of insulin to meet the body’s needs. Most pre-hospital care should be focused around the treatment of severe dehydration and support of vital functions.

PEARLS:
----------------------
1. Know your specific agency’s glucometer parameters for a “HI” and “LO” reading.
2. It is estimated that 2 - 8% of all hospital admissions are for the treatment of DKA, while mortality for DKA is between 2 - 10%. Published mortality rates for HHS vary, but the trend is that the older the patient and higher the osmolarity, the greater the risk of death.
