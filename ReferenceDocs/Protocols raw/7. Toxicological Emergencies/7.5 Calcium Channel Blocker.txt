Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose
==================================
OVERVIEW:
------------------
Overdose by immediate-release agents is characterized by rapid progression to hypotension, brady-arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Overdose by extended-release formulations can result in delayed onset of arrhythmias, shock, delayed cardiac collapse, and bowel ischemia. Unfortunately, the history of poisoning / overdose is notoriously unreliable whether it is obtained from the patient, friends and family members or emergency services personnel. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the most important historical factors include <b>what</b> poison was involved, <b>how much</b> was taken, <b>how</b> it was taken, <b>when</b> it was taken, <b>why</b> it was taken, and especially <b>what else</b> was taken. Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-222-1222) but <b>only Medical Control may give patient treatment orders</b>.

HPI
-------------
• Use or suspected use of a potentially toxic substance
• Substance ingested, route, and quantity used
• Time of use
• Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)
• Available medications in home
• Past medical history

Signs and Symptoms
----------------
• Mental status changes
• Hypotension
• Bradycardia, other dysrhythmias

Considerations
------------------
• Co-ingestions
• Cardiac medications
• Anti-hypertensive medications

Management
-----------------------
[management]

Common Calcium Channel Blocker Medications
---------------------------------------------
• Amlodipine (Norvasc)
• Bepridil (Vascor)
• Diltiazem (Cardizem)
• Felodipine (Plendil)
• Isradipine (Dynacirc)
• Nicardipine (Cardene)
• Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia)
• Nimodipine (Nimotop)
• Nisoldipine (Sular)
• Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin)

Dopamine IV Infusion
-----------------------------
Add 400 mg of Dopamine to 250 ml of NS (1600 mcg / ml) and attach 60 gtts IV tubing

PEARLS:
---------------
1. Aggressive cardiovascular support is necessary for management of massive calcium channel blocker overdose. While calcium may overcome some adverse effects of calcium channel blockers, it rarely restores normal cardiovascular status.
2. Consider using calcium only if a witness confirms a CCB overdose; calcium may induce fatal arrhythmias in digoxin overdose, which can present with similar findings.
3. Empiric use of glucagon (adults: 5 - 15 mg IV) may be warranted for patients with an unknown overdose presenting with bradycardia or hypotension.
4. Atropine may be tried if hemodynamically significant bradycardia occurs; however, heart block is usually resistant to atropine in CCB toxicity. Mid-dose dopamine (5 - 10 mcg / kg / min) may improve heart rate and contractility.<sup>1</sup>
5. According to many case reports, glucagon has been used with good results. However, vasopressors are frequently necessary for adequate resuscitation and should be administered early if hypotension occurs. 
6. Be prepared to manage the airway after Glucagon administration due to possible emesis. 
7. Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
8. Bring bottles and contents to ER with patient.
