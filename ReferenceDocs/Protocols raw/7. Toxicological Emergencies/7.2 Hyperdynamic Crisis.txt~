Obtain general assessment of the patient.

Suction oropharynx as necessary.
Obtain blood glucose sample. If glucose is < 60 mg / dL
or > 300 mg / dL, refer to Hypoglycemia or
Hyperglycemia protocol.

systolic BP > 90 mmHg.

STIMULANT OVERDOSE

OVERVIEW:
Hyperdynamic “stimulant” drugs, also known as sympathomimetics, include cocaine,
methamphetamine, amphetamine, and MDMA (ecstasy). Patient care should be
focused on preventing / mitigating hyperthermia, agitated delirium, positional asphyxia,
hypoxia, and physical self-harm. With a stimulant overdose (tachycardia, agitation,
hyperthermia, and / or hypertension), treatment with benzodiazepines is indicated in
addition to rhythm specific therapy or anti- hypertensive meds (with the exception of
beta-blockers). Unfortunately, the history of poisoning / overdose is notoriously
unreliable whether it is obtained from the patient, friends and family members or
emergency services personnel. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the most important
historical factors include what poison was involved, how much was taken, how it was
taken, when it was taken, why it was taken, and especially what else was taken.
Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-2221222) but only Medical Control may give patient treatment orders.

STIMULANT OVERDOSE

A
7. For chest pain due to suspected cocaine use, WITHOUT
ST elevation, administer MIDAZOLAM 5 mg IV. If
Midazolam is not available, administer DIAZEPAM 2.5 5 mg IV. Refer to Cardiac Care: Non-traumatic Chest
Discomfort protocol as needed.
8. If patient is seizing, refer to the Medical Care Seizure
protocol.
9. Transport promptly in position of comfort. Reassess vital
signs as indicated.

PEARLS:
1.
Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
2.
Bring bottles and contents to ER with patient.
3.
Ecstasy (MDMA), and the more toxic drug para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA),
have both amphetamine and hallucinatory like effects. The stimulant effects of
MDMA / PMA, which enable users to perform physical exertion (like dancing) for
extended periods, may also lead to dehydration, tachycardia, and hypertension.
MAOI’s may potentiate toxic effects. While any of the hyperdynamics can be
dangerous, MDMA and PMA especially have been known to cause a marked
increase in body temperature (malignant hyperthermia) leading to rapid onset of
muscle breakdown, DIC, seizures, renal failure, and cardiovascular system
failure.
