Signs and Symptoms
•
•
•

Mental status changes
Hypotension
Bradycardia

Obtain general assessment of the patient.
Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
Suction oropharynx as necessary.
Establish IV of Normal Saline. Titrate to maintain a
systolic BP > 90 mmHg.
5. Place the patient on a cardiac monitor and obtain /
interpret 12 lead ECG.
6. If symptomatic bradycardia is present, administer
ATROPINE 0.5 - 1 mg IVP / IO. If no response to initial
dose, administer one (1) repeat dose of Atropine 0.5 - 1
mg IVP / IO.

BETA BLOCKER OVERDOSE

OVERVIEW:
Beta blockers are a type of drug generally used to treat hypertension. Although the
specific ingredients vary among manufacturers, the main ingredient among them all is a
beta-adrenergic blocking substance. This substance blocks the effects of epinephrine
on the body. Medical complications of beta-blocker overdose include hypotension,
bradycardia, heart failure, impaired atrio-ventricular conduction, bronchospasm and,
occasionally, seizures. Unfortunately, the history of poisoning / overdose is notoriously
unreliable whether it is obtained from the patient, friends and family members or
emergency services personnel. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the most important
historical factors include what poison was involved, how much was taken, how it was
taken, when it was taken, why it was taken, and especially what else was taken.
Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-2221222) but only Medical Control may give patient treatment orders.

Bradycardia with associated hypotension and shock (systolic BP < 80 mm Hg, HR < 60
BPM) defines severe beta-blocker toxicity. Bradycardia by itself is not necessarily helpful
as a warning sign because slowing of the heart rate and dampening of tachycardia in
response to stress is observed with therapeutic levels.
Glucagon increases heart rate and myocardial contractility, and improves atrio-ventricular
conduction. These effects are unchanged by the presence of beta-receptor blocking
drugs. This suggests that glucagon's mechanism of action may bypass the betaadrenergic receptor site. Because it may bypass the beta-receptor site, glucagon can be
considered as an alternative therapy for profound beta-blocker intoxications.
Be prepared to manage the airway after Glucagon administration due to possible emesis.
While case reports have documented hypotension in the absence of bradycardia, blood
pressure usually does not fall before the onset of bradycardia. Bradycardia may be
isolated or accompanied by mild conduction disturbances affecting the entire cardiac
conduction system from the sinus node to the intraventricular Purkinje system.
Cardiac pacing may be effective in increasing the rate of myocardial contraction.
Electrical capture is not always successful and, if capture does occur, blood pressure is
not always restored. Reserve cardiac pacing for patients unresponsive to
pharmacological therapy. Multiple case reports describe complete neurological recovery,
even with profound hypotension, if a cardiac rhythm can be sustained.
Agents with combined alpha- and beta-selective properties (Dopamine and Epinephrine)
may be necessary to maintain blood pressure. A beta-agonist may competitively
antagonize the effect of the beta-blocker. The amount of beta-agonist required might be
several orders of magnitude above those recommended in standard ACLS protocols.
Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
Bring bottles and contents to ER with patient.
