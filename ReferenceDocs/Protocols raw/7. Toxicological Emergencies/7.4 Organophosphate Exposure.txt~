Organophosphate Exposure
========================
OVERVIEW:
-----------------
Organophosphates irreversibly bind to cholinesterase, causing the phosphorylation and deactivation of acetylcholinesterase. The accumulation of acetylcholine at the neural synapse causes an initial overstimulation, followed by exhaustion and disruption of postsynaptic neural transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). If the organophosphate / cholinesterase bond is not broken by pharmacologic intervention within 24 hours, large amounts of cholinesterase are destroyed, causing long-term morbidity or death. Carbamate poisoning exhibits a similar clinical picture to organophosphate toxicity. However, unlike organophosphates, carbamate compounds temporarily bind cholinesterase for approximately 6 hours with no permanent damage. Carbamates have poor CNS penetration and cause minimal CNS symptoms. The most important historical factors to obtain include: <b>what</b> poison was involved, <b>how long</b> the exposure lasted and <b>how</b> and <b>when</b> they were exposed. Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-2221222) but <b>only Medical Control may give patient treatment orders</b>.

HPI
-------------
• Exposure or suspected exposure of a potentially toxic substance
• Substance exposure, route, and quantity
• Time of exposure
• Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)
• Available medications in home
• Past medical history

Signs and Symptoms
-------------
• S.L.U.D.G.E.
• D.U.M.B.E.L.S.
• Bradycardia
• Hypotension
• Severe respiratory
• distress
• Blurred vision
• Paralysis

Considerations
-----------------
• Agricultural pesticides
• Home gardening products
• Industrial manufacturing products

Management
---------------------
Scene Safety and consider HAZ MAT activation.
Ensure patient has been thoroughly decontaminated.
Obtain general assessment of the patient.
Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
Suction oropharynx as necessary.
Establish IV of Normal Saline. Titrate to maintain a
systolic BP > 90 mmHg.
7. Place the patient on a cardiac monitor and obtain /
interpret 12 lead ECG.
8. If the patient has respiratory distress due to secretions,
administer ATROPINE SULFATE 1 - 2 mg IVP every 5
minutes until signs of pulmonary secretions decrease
improve or medication supply is exhausted. There is no
maximum dose in this situation.
9. If available, administer 2PAM 1 - 2 Gram IV one dose –
OR - 0.6 Gram IM x 3 doses in rapid succession.
10. If patient is seizing, refer to the Medical Care Seizure
protocol.
11. For bronchospasm, administer ALBUTEROL and
ATROVENT per Medial Care: Respiratory Distress
protocol.
12. Transport promptly in position of comfort. Reassess vital
signs as indicated.

PEARLS
-------------------
<b>***Decontamination MUST be completed prior to transport***</b>

1. Decontamination should be initiated and completed by <b><u>qualified personnel</u></b>.
2. Decontamination takes precedence over ALS interventions.
3. Consider calling for additional drug kits for additional atropine.
4. Separate patient from causative agent. Most exposures are to liquid solutions.
5. Clothes should be removed on scene, bagged and sealed by personnel wearing appropriate PPE, and left for appropriate disposal. DO NOT transport clothes in ambulance or to hospital where they may spread contamination.
6. DO NOT use personal antidote kit, if issued to provide patient care.
