Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose
==================================
OVERVIEW:
------------------
Overdose by immediate-release agents is characterized by rapid progression to hypotension, brady-arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Overdose by extended-release formulations can result in delayed onset of arrhythmias, shock, delayed cardiac collapse, and bowel ischemia. Unfortunately, the history of poisoning / overdose is notoriously unreliable whether it is obtained from the patient, friends and family members or emergency services personnel. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the most important historical factors include <b>what</b> poison was involved, <b>how much</b> was taken, <b>how</b> it was taken, <b>when</b> it was taken, <b>why</b> it was taken, and especially <b>what else</b> was taken. Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-222-1222) but <b>only Medical Control may give patient treatment orders</b>.

HPI
-------------
• Use or suspected use of a potentially toxic substance
• Substance ingested, route, and quantity used
• Time of use
• Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)
• Available medications in home
• Past medical history

Signs and Symptoms
----------------
• Mental status changes
• Hypotension
• Bradycardia, other dysrhythmias

Considerations
------------------
• Co-ingestions
• Cardiac medications
• Anti-hypertensive medications

Management
-----------------------
Obtain general assessment of the patient.
Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
Suction oropharynx as necessary.
Obtain blood glucose sample. If glucose is < 60 mg / dL
or > 300 mg / dL, refer to Hypoglycemia or
Hyperglycemia protocol.
5. Establish IV of Normal Saline. Titrate to maintain a
systolic BP > 90 mmHg.
6. Administer Normal Saline 250 ml Bolus as needed to
maintain systolic BP > 90 mmHg. Bolus amount should
not exceed 20 cc / kg. Caution should be used with
patients with history of renal failure and HF. Re-assess
after 250 ml for signs of fluid overload.
7. Place the patient on a cardiac monitor and obtain /
interpret 12 lead ECG. Refer to appropriate Cardiac
Care protocol.
8. Administer CALCIUM CHLORIDE 2.0 – 4.0 mg / kg IVP /
IO every 10 minutes until signs and symptoms improve.
9. If no response noted to Calcium Chloride, administer
GLUCAGON 1 mg IVP / IO. If no response in five (5)
minutes, administer one (1) repeat dose of Glucagon 1
mg IVP / IO.
10. Administer DOPAMINE Infusion 5 - 20 mcg / kg / minute
for hypotension that remains after fluid bolus
administration.
11. Transport promptly in position of comfort. Reassess vital
signs as indicated.

Common Calcium Channel Blocker Medications
---------------------------------------------
• Amlodipine (Norvasc)
• Bepridil (Vascor)
• Diltiazem (Cardizem)
• Felodipine (Plendil)
• Isradipine (Dynacirc)
• Nicardipine (Cardene)
• Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia)
• Nimodipine (Nimotop)
• Nisoldipine (Sular)
• Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin)

Dopamine IV Infusion

PEARLS:
---------------
1. Aggressive cardiovascular support is necessary for management of massive calcium channel blocker overdose. While calcium may overcome some adverse effects of calcium channel blockers, it rarely restores normal cardiovascular status.
2. Consider using calcium only if a witness confirms a CCB overdose; calcium may induce fatal arrhythmias in digoxin overdose, which can present with similar findings.
3. Empiric use of glucagon (adults: 5 - 15 mg IV) may be warranted for patients with an unknown overdose presenting with bradycardia or hypotension.
4. Atropine may be tried if hemodynamically significant bradycardia occurs; however, heart block is usually resistant to atropine in CCB toxicity. Mid-dose dopamine (5 - 10 mcg / kg / min) may improve heart rate and contractility.<sup>1</sup>
5. According to many case reports, glucagon has been used with good results. However, vasopressors are frequently necessary for adequate resuscitation and should be administered early if hypotension occurs. 
6. Be prepared to manage the airway after Glucagon administration due to possible emesis. 
7. Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
8. Bring bottles and contents to ER with patient.
