Opiate Overdose
=======================
OVERVIEW:
---------------
The goal in treating an opiate overdose patient is generally not to wake the patient, but to maintain breathing and the airway. While difficult, this is especially important as opiates are often mixed with stimulants and other drugs at the street level, and the opiate may be masking or suppressing other toxic effects. Unfortunately, the history of poisoning / overdose is notoriously unreliable whether it is obtained from the patient, friends and family members or emergency services personnel, and especially <b>what else</b> was taken. Poison Control may be contacted at any time for information on poisoning (1-800-222-1222) but <b>only Medical Control may give patient care direction</b>. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the most important historical factors include what poison was involved, <b>how much</b> was taken, <b>how</b> it was taken, <b>when</b> it was taken, <b>why</b> it was taken <b>treatment orders</b>.

HPI
-----------
• Use or suspected use of a potentially toxic substance
• Substance ingested, route, and quantity used
• Time of use
• Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)
• Available medications in home
• Past medical history

Signs and Symptoms
---------------------
• Mental status changes
• Hypotension / hypertension
• Hypothermia / hyperthermia
• Decreased respiratory rate
• Tachycardi, other dysrhythmias
• Seizures

Considerations
------------
• Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
• Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
• Depressants
• Stimulants
• Anticholinergic
• Cardiac medications
• Solvents, alcohols, Cleaning agents
• Insecticides

Management

Opiate Toxidrome
---------------------
• Altered Mental Status
• Miosis
• Unresponsiveness
• Shallow Respirations
• Slow Respiratory Rate
• Decreased Bowel Sounds
• Hypothermia
• Hypotension

PEARLS:
----------------
1. If patient is a suspected opiate addict, the administration of Naloxone should be titrated to increase respirations to normal levels without fully awakening patient to prevent hostile and confrontational episodes and withdrawal symptoms.
2. Any patient receiving Naloxone should be transported for continued monitoring. Many opiates have a longer bioavailability than Naloxone, therefore re-sedation may occur.
3. Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
