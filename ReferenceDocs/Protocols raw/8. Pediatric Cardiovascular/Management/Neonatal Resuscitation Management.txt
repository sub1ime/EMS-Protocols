Neonatal Resuscitation

==========================
1. If obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing or
requires positive pressure ventilation, gently suction the
newborn’s mouth, then nostrils, with a bulb syringe for 3
to 5 seconds. Don’t routinely suction an active baby.
2. If meconium staining is present:
a. If the newborn is vigorous (strong respiratory
effort, good muscle tone, and a heart rate greater
than 100 bpm), no routine suctioning is required.
b. If the newborn is NOT vigorous (poor or absent
respiratory effort, flaccid, lethargic), consider
immediate MECONIUM ASPIRATION via
endotracheal suctioning. Suctioning of
meconium should not distract from the need for
emergent oxygenation and ventilation of the
newly born. In the patient with meconium
aspiration and respiratory failure or apnea,
quickly suction meconium and then begin BVM
ventilations.
3. If meconium staining is not present, rub the newborn’s
back vigorously. Simultaneously begin drying and
warming measures.
4. KEEP THE NEWBORN WARM AND DRY.
5. Evaluate respirations, heart rate (apical pulse or pulse at
the base of the umbilical cord), and state of oxygenation.
Obtain 1 minute APGAR.
6. If respirations are inadequate, HR > 100 bpm:
a. Initiate positive-pressure ventilation with a BVM
NOT attached to oxygen. Deliver 40 to 60
breaths per minute. Use only enough volume to
make the newborn’s chest rise.
7. If respirations are inadequate and HR less than 100
bpm:
a. Initiate positive-pressure ventilation with a BVM
on room air. If no increase in HR after 90
seconds, administer 100% oxygen.
b. If HR is below 60 bpm, begin compressions.s
