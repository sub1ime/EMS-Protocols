=========================
EMTP/EMTI
------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform patient assessment.
<tr><td>2.<td>Administer Oxygen to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%.
<tr><td>3.<td>Assess for presence of nuchal cord (around the baby’s neck). If present, remove by slipping over the neck or by cutting and clamping.
<tr><td>4.<td>Keep the patient‘s knees pushed back to her abdomen / chest.
<tr><td>5.<td>Do not apply excessive downward traction on the head. Initially apply gently downward traction on the chest and back to try and free the shoulder. If this has no effect, do not exert increasing pressure.
<tr><td>6.<td>Place the mother in MacRobert’s position and apply gently downward traction on the baby again.
<tr><td>7.<td>If MacRobert’s maneuver fails, have an assistant apply downward, suprapubic pressure to drive the fetal shoulder downward and clear the pubic bone. Apply coordinated, gentle downward traction on the baby.
<tr><td>8.<td>If pressure straight down is ineffective, have assistant apply it in a more lateral direction. This should nudge the shoulder into a better position.
<tr><td>9.<td>If newborn continues not to progress, transport immediately to closed appropriate facility.
