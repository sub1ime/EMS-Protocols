Shoulder Dystocia

=========================
1. Perform patient assessment.
2. Administer Oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%.
3. Assess for presence of nuchal cord (around the baby’s
neck). If present, remove by slipping over the neck or by
cutting and clamping.
4. Keep the patient‘s knees pushed back to her abdomen /
chest.
5. Do not apply excessive downward traction on the head.
Initially apply gently downward traction on the chest and
back to try and free the shoulder. If this has no effect, do
not exert increasing pressure.
6. Place the mother in MacRobert’s position and apply
gently downward traction on the baby again.
7. If MacRobert’s maneuver fails, have an assistant apply
downward, suprapubic pressure to drive the fetal
shoulder downward and clear the pubic bone. Apply
coordinated, gentle downward traction on the baby.
8. If pressure straight down is ineffective, have assistant
apply it in a more lateral direction. This should nudge
the shoulder into a better position.
9. If newborn continues not to progress, transport
immediately to closed appropriate facility.
