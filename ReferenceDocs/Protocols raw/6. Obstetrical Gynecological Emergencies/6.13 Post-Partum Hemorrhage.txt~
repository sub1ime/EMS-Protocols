POST-PARTUM HEMMORRHAGE

OVERVIEW:
Post-partum hemorrhage is defined as the loss of more than 500 mL of blood loss
following vaginal delivery or more than 1,000 mL following a Cesarean delivery.
However, many women tolerate losses of up to 1,000 mL of blood. It can cause
debilitation and diminished immunity, which can subsequently lead to post-partum
infection, another leading cause of maternal death. Post-partum hemorrhage can occur
up to 6 weeks after delivery. It is imperative that hemorrhage is diagnosed early, and
treated aggressively.

POST-PARTUM HEMMORRHAGE

Continued

PEARLS:
1.
Many times, the estimated blood loss is only about half of the actual blood loss.
2.
Uterine atony, birth canal lacerations, and retention of placental fragments are
the three leading causes of post-partum hemorrhage. Other causes include
uterine inversion, and retained placenta. These all usually occur during the
immediate post-partum period.
3.
Post-partum hemorrhage can occur up to 6 weeks after delivery. The causes of
delayed or late post-partum hemorrhage include sub-involution of the placental
site, retained placental tissue, and infection.
4.
Uterine atony is usually caused by over-distention of the uterus from multiple
pregnancies, polyhydramnios, or an abnormally large fetus. The large blood
vessels in the uterus become open and gaping when the placenta separates
from the uterine wall. If the uterus fails to contract, as with uterine atony, large
blood loss can occur from those blood vessels.
Small, retained fragments of the placenta may interfere with proper uterine
5.
contraction, leading to hemorrhage. The placenta should be inspected at
delivery to ensure that no pieces are missing. This is rarely a cause of
immediate post-partum hemorrhage, but can be the cause of sudden profuse
bleeding one week or more post-partum.
6.
Sub-involution of the placental site in the uterus, or failure for it to return to
normal size, can cause late post-partum hemorrhage. It takes about 42 days for
these cells to epithelialize. During this healing time, clots can slough off and
cause bleeding.
