Signs and Symptoms
•

Childbirth

Perform general patient management.
Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 > 94%.
If time permits, establish IV of Normal Saline at KVO.
Apply gloves, mask, gown, eye protection for infection
control precautions.
Have mother lie with knees drawn up and spread apart.
Elevate buttocks - with blankets or pillow.
Create sterile field around vaginal opening. If available,
use OB kit.
If the amniotic sac does not break, or has not broken,
use a clamp to puncture the sac and push it away from
the head and mouth as they appear.
When the head appears during crowning, place fingers
on bony part of skull (not fontanelle or face) and exert
very gentle pressure to prevent explosive delivery. Use
caution to avoid fontanelle.

DELIVERY - UNCOMPLICATED

OVERVIEW:
In women with regular menstrual cycles, a history of one or more missed cycles
(periods) is suggestive of pregnancy. Labor is defined as progressive dilation of the
uterine cervix in association with repetitive uterine contractions resulting in complete
dilation (10 cm) and effacement (thinning) of the cervical lining. Vertex, or head-first
presentation, is the ideal presentation for all deliveries. Crowning is observed as the
second stage of labor begins.

10. As the head is being born, determine if the umbilical cord
is around the neck; slip over the shoulder or clamp, cut
and unwrap.
11. After the head is born, support the head. Suctioning is
no longer recommended at this point.
12. As the torso and full body are born, support the newborn
with both hands.
13. As the feet are born, grasp the feet.
14. Wipe blood and mucus from mouth and nose with sterile
gauze, suction mouth and nose.
15. Keep newborn level with vagina until the cord is cut.
16. Clamp, tie and cut umbilical cord (between the clamps)
as pulsations cease. May consider delay cutting in
infants that do not require resuscitation by one minute.
Apply the first clamp approximately 4 inches from
newborn and the second clamp approximately 6 inches
from the newborn.
17. Obtain 1 and 5 minute APGAR scores.
18. Assign partner to monitor newborn and refer to Neonatal
Resuscitation Protocol.
19. Observe for delivery of placenta while preparing mother
and newborn for transport.
20. When delivered, wrap placenta in towel and put in plastic
bag; transport placenta to hospital with mother.
21. Place sterile pad over vaginal opening, lower mother's
legs, help her hold them together.
22. Record time of delivery and transport mother, newborn
and placenta to hospital.

PEARLS:
1.
Normal number of vessels in umbilical cord is three, two arteries and one vein.
2.
There is increasing evidence of benefit of delaying cord clamping for at least one
minute in term and preterm infants not requiring resuscitation.
3.
Calculate estimated date of confinement (EDC) by adding 7 days to the first day
of the last normal menses and subtracting 3 months.
