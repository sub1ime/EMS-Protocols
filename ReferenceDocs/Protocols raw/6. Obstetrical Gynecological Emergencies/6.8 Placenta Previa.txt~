PROTOCOL TITLE: Placenta Previa
REVISED: 05/2012

OVERVIEW:
Placenta previa is an obstetric complication that occurs in the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy and accounts for 20% of vaginal bleeding during these last
trimesters. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta is implanted low in the uterus and
covers the cervical canal in varying amounts. The placenta may be marginally, partially,
or completely covering the internal cervical opening. Risk factors for placenta previa
include prior placenta previa, first pregnancy following a cesarean delivery, multi-parity,
age > 30 years, multiple gestations, prior induced abortions, and smoking.

1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%
4. Place patient in a position of comfort.
5. Establish an IV of Normal Saline
6. If the patient is exhibiting symptoms of shock, refer to
the Shock protocol.
7. Transport promptly and reassess as indicated.

PEARLS:
1.
Providers must NOT perform a pelvic exam on a patient with placenta previa.
Due to the placenta precariously placed over the cervical opening, minimal
maneuvers to the cervix or uterus may induce heavy vaginal bleeding.
2.
Avoid palpating the fundus, which may cause fetal movement and possible
placental tearing.
3.
Women older than 30 years are 3 times more likely to have placenta previa than
women younger than 20 years.
