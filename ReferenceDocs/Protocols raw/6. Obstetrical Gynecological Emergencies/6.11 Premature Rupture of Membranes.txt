Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM)
=========================
OVERVIEW:
-------------
Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM) is the leakage of amniotic fluid at least one (1) hour before the onset of labor. This can occur at any gestational age, and occurs in approximately 10% of all pregnancies. The exact cause of PROM is not known and can lead to premature labor, umbilical cord prolapse, and intrauterine infection. The patient usually reports a gush of fluid from the vagina. There may also be a continual leak of fluid, suggestive of a small tear in the amniotic sac.
