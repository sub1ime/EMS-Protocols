Rash, skin break,

Pain, soft tissue

Allergic reaction,
hives, itching
Hypotension or shock

1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Treat for shock and conserve body heat. Keep the
patient calm.
4. If applicable, locate the fang marks and clean the site
with soap and water. Note: There may be only one fang
mark.
5. Remove any rings, bracelets, or other constricting items
on the bitten / stung extremity.
6. Keep any bitten / stung extremities immobilized – the
application of a splint will help. Keep the injury at the
level of the heart. When not possible, keep the injury
below the level of the heart.

BITES AND ENVENOMATIONS

OVERVIEW:
Insect stings and human, animal, snake, or spider bites from a variety of species can
result in serious illness and injury. Animal bites from wild animals such as skunks, bats,
raccoons, and foxes pose a special risk of rabies. Snakebites or stings from insects or
spiders inject poisonous venom into their victims, generally affecting the cardiovascular
or neurological system. Individual reactions to venom vary greatly depending on the
person’s sensitivity. Five percent of the general population is allergic to the stings of
wasps, bees, hornets, yellow jackets, and ants. Insect stings cause twice as many
deaths as snakebites each year. Anaphylactic shock can occur from any source, refer to
the Allergic Reaction / Anaphylaxis Patient Care Protocol as needed. Do not apply ice
or cold packs to snakebites as this can cause additional tissue damage. However, ice or
cold packs can be applied to insect bites to reduce pain and swelling.

BITES AND ENVENOMATIONS

Continued

7. DO NOT apply light constricting bands above and below
the wound.
8. If envenomation is suspected, every 15 minutes, use a
pen to mark the border of the advancing edema and
document the time.
9. Consult Medical Control or Poison Control. For serious
envenomation, the patient may need to be transported or
evacuated to a hospital with the appropriate anti-venom.
10. Start an IV of Normal Saline at KVO.
11. For signs and symptoms of shock, follow the Shock
protocol.
12. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.

***Adequate identification of the snake is important. If the snake is live, contact local
animal control and relay any available information regarding the identification of the
snake to the receiving facility.***
DO NOT TRANSPORT A LIVE SNAKE IN THE AMBULANCE
PEARLS:
1.
Do not apply any type of constricting band or tourniquets as a treatment for any
kind of bite or envenomation unless used to control severe hemorrhage.
2.
Human bites are worse than animal bites due to the normal mouth bacteria.
3.
Carnivore bites are more likely to become infected and all have risk of rabies
exposure.
4.
Cat bites may progress to infection rapidly due to a specific bacterium.
5.
Poisonous snakes in this area are generally of the pit viper family: eastern
diamondback rattlesnake, copperhead, and water moccasin.
6.
The amount of envenomation with snake bites is variable, but is generally worse
with larger snakes and early in Spring.
7.
If no pain or swelling is noted, envenomation is unlikely.
8.
Black Widow spider bites tend to be minimally painful but, over a few fours,
muscular pain and severe abdominal pain may develop.
9.
Brown Recluse spider bites are minimally painful to painless. Little reaction is
noted initially, but tissue necrosis at the site of the bite normally develops over
two to three days.
10.
Signs and symptoms of infection include swelling, redness, drainage, fever, and
red streaks proximal to the wound.
11.
Immuno-compromised patients with diabetes, chemotherapy, organ transplants,
HIV / AIDS, etc, are at an increased risk for infection.
