Bites and Envonomations

===================================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Treat for shock and conserve body heat. Keep the
patient calm.
4. If applicable, locate the fang marks and clean the site
with soap and water. Note: There may be only one fang
mark.
5. Remove any rings, bracelets, or other constricting items
on the bitten / stung extremity.
6. Keep any bitten / stung extremities immobilized â€“ the
application of a splint will help. Keep the injury at the
level of the heart. When not possible, keep the injury
below the level of the heart.
7. DO NOT apply light constricting bands above and below
the wound.
8. If envenomation is suspected, every 15 minutes, use a
pen to mark the border of the advancing edema and
document the time.
9. Consult Medical Control or Poison Control. For serious
envenomation, the patient may need to be transported or
evacuated to a hospital with the appropriate anti-venom.
10. Start an IV of Normal Saline at KVO.
11. For signs and symptoms of shock, follow the Shock
protocol.
12. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
