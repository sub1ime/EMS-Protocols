Hyperthermia

===========================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway,
breathing, and circulation.
3. Remove the patient from the hot environment to a cool
environment. Do not allow the patient to shiver with
cooling techniques.
4. Administer oxygen, to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. Support
respirations as necessary with a BVM.
5. Heat Cramps: Signs and symptoms include muscle
twitching, followed by painful spasms, especially involving
the lower extremities and abdomen, nausea and vomiting,
weakness and diaphoresis.
a. PO fluids may be given as long as the patient
maintains a patent airway and is not vomiting.
6. Heat Exhaustion: Signs and symptoms include: pallor,
profuse sweating, orthostatic hypotension, headache,
weakness, fatigue and thirst.
a. Establish an IV of Normal Saline. Infuse the fluid
amounts listed in the Shock protocol. If the patient
develops signs and symptoms of fluid overload
respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi,
decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
b. Place on cardiac monitor.
7. Heat Stroke: Signs and symptoms include: altered
mental status, increased body temperature, minimal or no
sweating, collapse, shortness of breath, shock, nausea
and vomiting.
a. Remove the patient’s clothing.
b. Do not give anything by mouth.
c. Spray the patient’s skin with a lukewarm water mist
and fan the patient. Continue misting and fanning
during transport.
d. Wrap the patient with wet sheets if there is good
ambient airflow present.
e. Establish an IV / IO of Normal Saline. Infuse the
fluid amounts listed in the Shock protocol. If the
patient develops signs and symptoms of fluid
overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles,
rhonchi, decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
f. Place on cardiac monitor and obtain 12 lead ECG
per assessment.
8. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
