EMTP/EMTI
-------------------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Remove the patient from the hot environment to a cool environment. Do not allow the patient to shiver with cooling techniques.
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer oxygen, to maintain <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>5.<td><b>Heat Cramps:</b> Signs and symptoms include muscle twitching, followed by painful spasms, especially involving the lower extremities and abdomen, nausea and vomiting, weakness and diaphoresis.
<tr><td>a.<td>PO fluids may be given as long as the patient maintains a patent airway and is not vomiting.
<tr><td>6.<td><b>Heat Exhaustion:</b> Signs and symptoms include: pallor, profuse sweating, orthostatic hypotension, headache, weakness, fatigue and thirst.
<tr><td>a.<td>Establish an IV of Normal Saline. Infuse the fluid amounts listed in the <i><u>Shock protocol</u></i>. If the patient develops signs and symptoms of fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> ), slow the IV to KVO.
<tr><td>b.<td>Place on cardiac monitor.
<tr><td>7.<td><b>Heat Stroke:</b> Signs and symptoms include: altered mental status, increased body temperature, minimal or no sweating, collapse, shortness of breath, shock, nausea and vomiting.
<tr><td>a.<td>Remove the patient’s clothing.
<tr><td>b.<td>Do not give anything by mouth.
<tr><td>c.<td>Spray the patient’s skin with a lukewarm water mist and fan the patient. Continue misting and fanning during transport.
<tr><td>d.<td>Wrap the patient with wet sheets if there is good ambient airflow present.
<tr><td>e.<td>Establish an IV / IO of Normal Saline. Infuse the fluid amounts listed in the Shock protocol. If the patient develops signs and symptoms of fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> ), slow the IV to KVO. 
<tr><td>f.<td>Place on cardiac monitor and obtain <i><u>12 lead ECG</u></i> per assessment.
<tr><td>8.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
