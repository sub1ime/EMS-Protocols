Hypothermia

========================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Hypothermia WITH a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
a. Prevent additional evaporative heat loss by
removing wet garments and insulating the victim
from further environmental exposures.
b. Initiate passive rewarming with warmed blankets
and a warm environment.
c. Perform procedures gently. These patients are
prone to develop ventricular fibrillation.
4. Hypothermia WITHOUT a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
a. Begin CPR immediately.

b. Initiate rewarming procedures as noted in step #3
above.
c. If not breathing, start rescue breathing
immediately. If possible, administer warmed,
humidified oxygen.
d. If pulseless with no detectable signs of
circulation, start chest compressions
immediately. If there is any doubt about whether
a pulse is present, begin compressions.
e. Assess cardiac rhythm:
i. Attach AED / cardiac monitor. If the
patient does not respond to one (1)
defibrillation, further defibrillation attempts
should be deferred.
f. Secure airway with a definitive (Supraglottic /
dual lumen) airway device or an endotracheal
tube (levels I and P only).
g. Establish an IV of Normal Saline.
h. Give initial cardiovascular drugs based on
presenting rhythm. If the patient fails to respond
to the initial drug therapy, defer additional
boluses of medication.
i. Continue CPR and transport immediately.
5. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
