<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>3.<td>Hypothermia <b>WITH</b> a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
<tr><td>a.<td>Prevent additional evaporative heat loss by removing wet garments and insulating the victim from further environmental exposures.
<tr><td>b.<td>Initiate passive rewarming with warmed blankets and a warm environment.
<tr><td>c.<td>Perform procedures gently. These patients are prone to develop ventricular fibrillation.
<tr><td>4.<td>Hypothermia WITHOUT a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
<tr><td>a.<td>Begin CPR immediately.
<tr><td>b.<td>Initiate rewarming procedures as noted in step #3 above.
<tr><td>c.<td>If not breathing, start rescue breathing immediately. If possible, administer warmed, humidified oxygen.
<tr><td>d.<td>If pulseless with no detectable signs of circulation, start chest compressions immediately. If there is any doubt about whether a pulse is present, begin compressions.
<tr><td>e.<td>Assess cardiac rhythm:
<tr><td>i.<td>Attach AED / cardiac monitor. If the patient does not respond to one (1) defibrillation, further defibrillation attempts should be deferred.
<tr><td>f.<td>Secure airway with a definitive (<i><u>Supraglottic / dual lumen</u></i>) airway device or an <i><u>endotracheal tube</u></i> (levels I and P only).
<tr><td>g.<td>Establish an IV of Normal Saline.
<tr><td>h.<td>Give initial cardiovascular drugs based on presenting rhythm. If the patient fails to respond to the initial drug therapy, defer additional boluses of medication.
<tr><td>i.<td>Continue CPR and transport immediately.
<tr><td>5.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
