Hypothermia
=========================

HPI
------------
• Past medical history
• Medications
• Exposure to environment even in normal temperatures
• Exposure to extreme cold
• Extremes of age
• Drug use: alcohol, barbiturates
• Infection, sepsis
• Length of exposure, wetness

Signs and Symptoms
-----------------------
• Cold, clammy
• Shivering
• Mental status changes
• Extremity pain, sensory abnormality
• Bradycardia
• Hypotension, shock

Considerations
--------------------
• Sepsis
• Environmental exposure
• Hypoglycemia
• CNS dysfunction
   o Stroke
   o Head injury
   o Spinal cord injury

Management
-------------------------
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Hypothermia WITH a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
a. Prevent additional evaporative heat loss by
removing wet garments and insulating the victim
from further environmental exposures.
b. Initiate passive rewarming with warmed blankets
and a warm environment.
c. Perform procedures gently. These patients are
prone to develop ventricular fibrillation.
4. Hypothermia WITHOUT a perfusing rhythm (pulse):
a. Begin CPR immediately.

HYPOTHERMIA

OVERVIEW:
Hypothermia is typically defined as a core temperature less than 35° Celsius / 95°
Fahrenheit. While most commonly seen in cold climates, it may develop without
exposure to extreme environmental conditions. Hypothermia is not uncommon in
temperate regions and may develop indoors even during summer. Hypothermia should
be considered in any patient with an altered level of consciousness in a cool and /or wet
environment. Individuals at the extremes of age and those of altered mental status are
more susceptible to developing hypothermia. Vasoconstriction and bradycardia may
cause extreme difficulty while attempting to palpate a pulse. Radiation accounts for the
greatest form of heat loss. Conduction normally accounts for a much smaller amount,
but increases significantly in wet clothes and astronomically in cold water. In patients
that are hypothermic, pulse and respiratory rates may be slow or difficult to detect. If the
hypothermic victim has no signs of life, begin CPR without delay.

b. Initiate rewarming procedures as noted in step #3
above.
c. If not breathing, start rescue breathing
immediately. If possible, administer warmed,
humidified oxygen.
d. If pulseless with no detectable signs of
circulation, start chest compressions
immediately. If there is any doubt about whether
a pulse is present, begin compressions.
e. Assess cardiac rhythm:
i. Attach AED / cardiac monitor. If the
patient does not respond to one (1)
defibrillation, further defibrillation attempts
should be deferred.
f. Secure airway with a definitive (Supraglottic /
dual lumen) airway device or an endotracheal
tube (levels I and P only).
g. Establish an IV of Normal Saline.
h. Give initial cardiovascular drugs based on
presenting rhythm. If the patient fails to respond
to the initial drug therapy, defer additional
boluses of medication.
i. Continue CPR and transport immediately.
5. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.

If the core temperature falls below 32°C / 90°F, a
characteristic J-wave (Osborn wave) may occur.
The J-wave occurs at the junction of the QRS
complex and the ST segment. T-wave inversion
and prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QT interval
may be noted.

Stages of Hypothermia
Normal Cold Response (35° C – 37° C / 95.1°F – 98.6°F)
Feeling of cold
• Vasoconstriction
Shivering
Mild Hypothermia (34°C – 35°C / 93°F – 95°F)
• Increasing rate of respirations
Maximum shivering at 35°C / 95°F
• Mild confusion
Cold, pale skin (vasoconstriction)
• Slurred speech
Pulse and BP are normal or
• Unsteady gait
elevated
• Amnesia
Moderate Hypothermia (30°C – 34°C / 86°F – 93°F)
No longer shivering
• Intense vasoconstriction – surface
pooling
Bradycardia
• Decreased LOC
Decreased respirations
• Increased mortality in major trauma
Increased risk of cardiac
by 40 - 50%
arrhythmia (A-Fib)
Severe Hypothermia (< 30°C / < 86°F)
Intense vasoconstriction – surface
• Non-cardiac pulmonary edema
pooling
• As core temp continues to
Lethal cardiac dysrhythmias (V-Fib)
decrease, risk of cardiac arrest
increases dramatically

PEARLS:
1.
Resuscitation efforts should not be ceased until rewarming efforts have been
exhausted, unless patient presents with injuries incompatible with life.
2.
Extremes of age, young and old, are more susceptible to effects of temperature.
3.
With temperature less than 31°C / 88°F, ventricular fibrillation is a common cause
of death.
4.
Patient with extreme hypothermia MUST be handled gently.
5.
Cardiac arrest patients should be warmed before administering medications, as
they may build in the system due to metabolism being ineffective.
6.
Defibrillation should be limited to one (1) shock prior to warming core.
7.
If the temperature is unable to be measured, treat based on the suspected
temperature.
8.
Hypothermia may cause severe bradycardia.
9.
Shivering typically ceases when core temperature is below 32°C / 90°F.
10.
Hot packs can be activated and placed in the armpit and groin areas, if available.
11.
If patient is found with wet clothes, patient should be exposed prior to application
of blankets.
12.
Hypothermic patients also exhibit cold diuresis. Peripheral vasoconstriction
initially causes central hypervolemia, to which the kidneys respond by excreting
large amounts of dilute urine, causing dehydration. Alcohol and water immersion
increase this process.
