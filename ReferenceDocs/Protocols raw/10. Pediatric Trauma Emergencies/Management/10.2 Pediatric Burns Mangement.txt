Pediatric Burns

==========================
1. Stop the burning process:
a. Thermal burns: Lavage the burned area with
sterile water or saline to cool skin. Do not attempt
to wipe off semisolids (grease, tar, wax, etc.) Do
not apply ice. Dry the body when the burn area
is greater than or equal to 10% TBSA to prevent
hypothermia.
b. Dry chemical burns: Brush off dry powder, then
lavage with copious amounts of tepid water
(sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en
route to the hospital.
c. Liquid chemical burns: Lavage the burned area
with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if
possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to
the hospital.
2. Support life-threatening problems.
3. Perform general patient management.

4. Administer oxygen, via non-rebreather mask, at 10 - 15
L / min. as necessary. Use humidified oxygen if
suspected inhalation injury and when available.
5. If the patient is in critical respiratory distress, consider
early placement of an advanced airway. *Endotracheal
Intubation / cricothyrotomy are reserved as Paramedic
only.
6. Remove clothing from around burned area, but do not
remove/peel off skin or tissue. Remove and secure all
jewelry and tight fitting clothing.
7. Assess the extent of the burn using the rule of nines and
the degree of burn severity.
8. Cover the burned area with a clean, dry dressing. Wet
dressing may be used if the burned TBSA is less than
10%.
9. If a partial or full thickness burn involves more than 20%
TBSA, establish an IV of normal saline. Infuse the fluid
amounts listed in the PARKLAND FORMULA FLUID
GUIDE. If the patient develops signs and symptoms of
fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles,
rhonchi, decreasing SpO 2 ), slow the IV to KVO.
10. For pain control, refer to the Pediatric Pain Management
protocol.
11. Perform ongoing assessment as indicated and transport
major burns to Level 1 Burn Center. Transport minor
burns to appropriate facility.
