Inhalation Injury
==========================



Hydrogen cyanide is a by-product of the combustion of materials used in everyday life products (i.e., insulation, carpets, clothing, and synthetics). The culprit is nitrogen. Nitrogen gas in atmospheric air can contribute (under the right circumstances) to the formation of minute amounts of cyanide during combustion. High temperatures and lowoxygen concentrations favor the formation of cyanide gas. Smoke from the combustion of grass clippings, green wood, tobacco, cotton, paper, wool, silk, weeds, and animal carcasses will likely contain some hydrogen cyanide gas. But the real offender is the combustion of manmade plastic and resins containing nitrogen, especially if the fire is hot and in an enclosed space. Common manmade materials that generate cyanide gas during combustion include nylon, polyurethane, melamine, and acrylonitrile.<sup>1</sup>

HPI
--------------------
• Type of exposure (heat, gas, chemical)
• Inhalation injury
• Time of injury
• Past medical history
• Medications
• Other trauma

Signs and Symptoms
----------------------
• Burns, pain, swelling
• Dizziness
• Loss of consciousness
• Hypotension/ shock
• Airway compromise, distress
• Singed facial or nasal hair
• Hoarseness, wheezing

Considerations
--------------------
• Electrical
• Chemical
• Thermal
• Radiation


Management
--------------------------------
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.



INHALATION INJURY

OVERVIEW:
A majority of fire related deaths are the result of smoke inhalation. Suspect inhalation
injury and respiratory damage in any victim of a thermal burn, particularly if the patient
has facial burns, singed nasal hair, carbonaceous sputum or was in an enclosed space.
Be aware that many chemicals are present during ordinary combustion including
Hydrogen Sulfide, Hydrogen Cyanide and Carbon Monoxide (CO). CO is a tasteless,
odorless, colorless, and non-irritating gas. Almost any flame or combustion device can
produce the gas. CO poisoning is a common problem and produces a broad spectrum
of signs and symptoms, often imitating the flu. Think about CO poisoning when multiple
patients present with the same signs and symptoms at a residence.

3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%. If
indicated, support respirations with a BVM.
4. Consider orotracheal intubation for impending
respiratory failure.
5. Monitor capnography, if available. Maintain a range
between 35 - 45 Torr.
6. Place patient on cardiac monitor and obtain/interpret 12
lead ECG. Refer to appropriate Cardiac Care protocol.
7. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.
8. If carbon monoxide is suspected or confirmed,
administer O 2 with non-rebreather mask.
9. If cyanide is suspected or confirmed, and kit is available,
administer Cyanokit®. **See administration instructions.
10. If available, consider CPAP with 5 - 10 cm H 2 0 PEEP.
11. Transport to Burn Center and perform ongoing
assessment as indicated.

**Cyanokit Infusion 2
Mix and administer Cyanokit infusion:
1. Add 100 ml of Normal Saline injection to
Hydroxocobalamin 2.5 gm vial using transfer
spike.
2. Fill to line on bottle with vial in upright position.
3. Rock or rotate vial for 30 seconds to mix solution.
Do not shake.
4. Attach included vented IV tubing. Infuse over 7.5
minutes.
5. Once initial bottle has infused, mix second bottle
as noted above and infuse over 7.5 minutes. Do
not infuse both bottles simultaneously.
6. Total amount infused should be documented as 5.0
gm when both vials are used as directed.

INHALATION INJURY

PEARLS:
1.
Pulse oximetry may give falsely elevated readings in patients with
methemoglobin or CO / CN exposure.
2.
Hyperbaric therapy can be indicated for some carbon monoxide poisonings;
especially in early pregnancy and patients with failing vital signs. For fire related
exposures, transport to the burn center at VCU health systems. For non-fire
related CO exposures, contact Medical Control for guidance. Hyperbaric
chambers are located at Chippenham, Southside Regional, Retreat Doctor’s
Hospital, Halifax Regional, UVA, VA Baptist, DePaul Medical Center, and
Sentara Leigh hospital.
3.
Critical burns: burns over > 25% TBSA; 2° burns > 10% TBSA; 2° and 3° burns
to the face, eyes, hands, or feet; electrical burns; respiratory burns; deep
chemical burns; burns with extremes of age or chronic disease; and burns with
associated major traumatic injury. These patients should be transferred directly
to a burn center.
Have a high index of suspicion and a low intubation threshold when treating burn
4.
patients with possible airway involvement. Early intubation should be considered
in significant inhalation injuries.
5.
Burn patients are prone to hypothermia – never cool burns that involve > 15%
TBSA.
6.
Never overlook the possibility of multi-system trauma.
