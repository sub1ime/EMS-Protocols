Conducted Energy Device Injuries
=========================================
OVERVIEW:
------------------------
A conducted energy device is a non-lethal, battery-operated device that can deliver 50,000 volts of electricity in rapid pulses that stimulate the nerves in the body. This highvoltage, low-amperage electrical discharge overrides the body’s muscle-triggering mechanisms causing neuromuscular incapacitation. This neuromuscular incapacitation overrides the patient’s sensory and motor nerves of the peripheral nervous system by disrupting the electrical impulses sent by the brain to command skeletal muscle function.

HPI
------------
• Events leading to incident
• Drug, ETOH ingestion
• Medical history (especially cardiac)
• Medications
• Last tetanus

Signs and Symptoms
----------------------
• Local injury
• Altered mental status, unconsciousness
• Respiratory distress
• Chest pain
• Cardiac, respiratory arrest

Considerations
-----------------------
• Drug / ETOH ingestion
• Cardiac rhythm disturbance
• Myocardial infarction
• Respiratory arrest
• Cardiac arrest

Management
----------------------------------
[management]

Note
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current medical literature does not support routing performance of laboratory studies, electrocardiograms, or prolonged ED observation or hospitalization for ongoing cardiac monitoring after CEW exposure in an otherwise asymptomatic, awake and alert patient.

PEARLS:
----------------------
1. If deployed by law enforcement, before touching any patient that has been subdued using a conducted energy device, ensure that the law enforcement officer has disconnected the deployment cartridge from the hand held unit.
2. If deployed by law enforcement, the probes and all connecting wires are considered evidence by law enforcement and should be maintained for collection.
3. Due to case reports of deaths associated with subjects subdued with these types of devices, all victims should be transported to the hospital for a thorough evaluation.
4. A known or unknown pre-existing cardiac history may cause unexpected cardiac arrest during or after Taser use. All patients should have a 12-Lead ECG performed to determine possible cardiac abnormality.
5. Encourage law enforcement to accompany patient, in ambulance, during transport to receiving facility.
