Crush injuries
==================================
OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------
Crush injuries can result from a variety of mechanisms including mine cave-ins, trench collapses, building collapse, vehicular collisions or industrial accidents. Also called traumatic rhabdomyolysis, it is defined as the prolonged compression, usually 4 - 6 hours but possibly less than 1 hour, of large muscle mass and compromised local circulation. Crush syndrome may also be exacerbated by hypovolemia secondary to hemorrhage. Compression on the body causes a disruption in tissue perfusion to a muscle group leading to cellular hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Cellular perfusion is further decreased due to hemorrhage from torn or compressed vessels. Once the compressive force is relieved, blood flow resumes, releasing the toxic substances that have been collecting in the compressed areas into the systemic circulation. This can result in systemic metabolic acidosis, widespread vasodilation, and hyperkalemia. Metabolic acidosis and high potassium levels could have deleterious effects on the myocardium and lead to patient death. Cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia typically occurs within the first hour of removal from compression. <u>Because of this, treatment for crush injuries begins prior to patient removal from compression</u>.

HPI
------------------
• Entrapment of one or more extremities and/ or trunk
• Time entrapped
• Medical history
• Allergies
• Heart Failure

Signs and Symptoms
---------------------------
• Obvious crushing of a muscle mass (arm, leg, etc.)

Considerations
------------------
• Extremity fracture
• Paralysis, Spinal cord injury
• Compartment syndrome

Managment
--------------------------------
[managment]

Note
-------------------------------------
**Suggestive signs of Hyperkalemia

• Peaked T waves in V1 and V2
• Widened QRS (> 0.12 seconds)
• QTc > 500

If any of these findings are noted on a 12 lead: Contact Medical Control

PEARLS:
-------------------------
1. A patient with a crush injury may initially present with very few signs and symptoms. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury.
2. Elevated potassium levels have an increased risk of affecting the myocardium resulting in ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Suspect hyperkalemia if T-waves become peaked, QRS becomes prolonged (> 0.12 seconds), absent P wave, or prolonged QTc**.
4. If a possible field amputation is anticipated, contact Medical Control for guidance.
5. Sodium Bicarbonate will keep the urine alkalotic and assist in preventing acute renal failure.
