Crush Injuries

===========================================
1. Perform general patient management.
2. Support life-threatening problems.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain a SPO 2 between 94 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
4. Consider activation of local and / or regional technical
rescue team.
5. Start an IV of normal saline and administer normal saline
20 cc / kg bolus, prior to extrication if possible. Maintain
perfusion by following the Medical Patient-Shock
protocol. DO NOT USE LACTATED RINGERS.
6. Apply BUT DO NOT TIGHTEN tourniquet on entrapped
extremity BEFORE extrication. Tighten only if major
hemorrhage occurs with extrication.

A
7. Attach ECG monitor. Obtain / interpret 12 Lead ECG.
Carefully monitor for dysrhythmias before, immediately
after release of pressure and during transport (i.e.,
peaked T waves, wide QRS, lengthening QT interval,
loss of P wave). Contact Medical Control if
hyperkalemia is suspected.**
8. Transport as soon as possible.
9. For pain control, consider analgesics
a. FENTANYL 1 mcg / kg IV / IM, not to exceed 50
mcg single dose. Repeat dose in 10 minutes if
necessary. Max total dose is 200 mcg.
b. If Fentanyl is unavailable, give MORPHINE 0.1
mg / kg IV at 1 mg / min, not to exceed 5 mg
single dose with max total dose of 20 mg. If no
IV established, administer MORPHINE 0.1 mg /
kg IM, not to exceed 10 mg (1.0 mL); repeat IM
dose in 10 minutes if necessary.
10. Consider the following options:
a. Continued boluses of normal saline.
b. For significant crush injuries, administer SODIUM
BICARBONATE 1 mEq / kg IV bolus over 2
minutes. Consider administration of bicarb
containing IV solution (One liter of D 5W with 2
amps bicarb infused at 150 cc / hour).
c. If ECG suggestive of hyperkalemia,** consider
ALBUTEROL 5.0 mg via small volume nebulizer.
d. If ECG suggestive of hyperkalemia, consider
CALCIUM CHLORIDE 8 mg / kg of 10% solution
IV over 5 minutes.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
