===========================================
EMTP/EMTI
-----------
<table><tr><td>1.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>2.<td>Support life-threatening problems.
<tr><td>3.<td>Administer oxygen to maintain a <i><u>SPO</u></i><sub>2</sub> between 94 - 99%. Support respirations as necessary with a BVM.
<tr><td>4.<td>Consider activation of local and / or regional technical rescue team.
<tr><td>5.<td>Start an IV of normal saline and administer normal saline 20 cc / kg bolus, prior to extrication if possible. Maintain perfusion by following the <i><u>Medical Patient-Shock protocol</u></i>. <b>DO NOT USE LACTATED RINGERS</b>.
<tr><td>6.<td>Apply BUT DO NOT TIGHTEN <i><u>tourniquet</u></i> on entrapped extremity BEFORE extrication. Tighten only if major hemorrhage occurs with extrication.
<tr><td>7.<td>Attach ECG monitor. Obtain / interpret <i><u>12 Lead ECG</u></i>. Carefully monitor for dysrhythmias before, immediately after release of pressure and during transport (i.e., peaked T waves, wide QRS, lengthening QT interval, loss of P wave). Contact Medical Control if hyperkalemia is suspected.**
<tr><td>8.<td>Transport as soon as possible.
<tr><td>9.<td>For pain control, consider analgesics
<tr><td>a.<td><i><u>FENTANYL</u></i> 1 mcg / kg IV / IM, not to exceed 50 mcg single dose. Repeat dose in 10 minutes if necessary. Max total dose is 200 mcg.
<tr><td>b.<td>If Fentanyl is unavailable, give <i><u>MORPHINE</u></i> 0.1 mg / kg IV at 1 mg / min, not to exceed 5 mg single dose with max total dose of 20 mg. If no IV established, administer <i><u>MORPHINE</u></i> 0.1 mg / kg IM, not to exceed 10 mg (1.0 mL); repeat IM dose in 10 minutes if necessary.
<tr><td>10.<td>Consider the following options:
<tr><td>a.<td>Continued boluses of normal saline.
<tr><td>b.<td>For significant crush injuries, administer <i><u>SODIUM BICARBONATE</u></i> 1 mEq / kg IV bolus over 2 minutes. Consider administration of bicarb containing IV solution (One liter of D 5W with 2 amps bicarb infused at 150 cc / hour).
<tr><td>c.<td>If ECG suggestive of hyperkalemia,** consider <i><u>ALBUTEROL</u></i> 5.0 mg via small volume nebulizer.
<tr><td>d.<td>If ECG suggestive of hyperkalemia, consider <i><u>CALCIUM CHLORIDE</u></i> 8 mg / kg of 10% solution IV over 5 minutes.
<tr><td>11.<td>Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.
