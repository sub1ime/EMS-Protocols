Burns

====================

1. Stop the burning process.
a. Thermal burns: Irrigate the burned area with
sterile water or saline to cool skin. Do not
attempt to wipe off semisolids (grease, tar,
wax, etc.). Do not apply ice. Dry the body
when the burn area is greater than or equal to
10% TBSA to prevent hypothermia.
b. Dry chemical burns: Brush off dry powder,
then lavage with copious amounts of tepid
water (sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes.
Continue en route to the hospital.
c. Liquid chemical burns: Irrigate the burned area
with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if
possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to
the hospital.
2. Perform general patient management.

3. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
4. Administer oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 10 - 15
L / min. as necessary.
5. If the patient is in critical respiratory distress or
impending respiratory failure, consider placement of
orotracheal intubation.
6. Remove clothing from around burned area, but do not
remove / peel off skin or tissue. Remove and secure
all jewelry and tight fitting clothing.
7. Assess the extent of the burn using the palm surface
area or the rule of nines and the degree of burn
severity.
8. Cover the burned area with a clean, dry dressing.
Wet dressing may be used if the burned TBSA is less
than 10%.
9. For pain control, provided SBP greater than 100, no
systemic injuries, and no altered mental status, refer
to Medical Patient Care: Pain Management Protocol.
10. Maintain body temperature.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.
