<tr><td>b.<td>Dry chemical burns: Brush off dry powder, then lavage with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to the hospital.
<tr><td>c.<td>Liquid chemical burns: Irrigate the burned area with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to the hospital.
<tr><td>2.<td>Perform general patient management.
<tr><td>3.<td>Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
<tr><td>4.<td>Administer oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 10 - 15 L / min. as necessary.

<tr><td>6.<td>Remove clothing from around burned area, but do not remove / peel off skin or tissue. Remove and secure all jewelry and tight fitting clothing.
<tr><td>7.<td>Assess the extent of the burn using the palm surface area or the rule of nines and the degree of burn severity.
<tr><td>8.<td>Cover the burned area with a clean, dry dressing. Wet dressing may be used if the burned TBSA is less than 10%.
<tr><td>9.<td>For pain control, provided SBP greater than 100, no systemic injuries, and no altered mental status, refer to <i><u>Medical Patient Care: Pain Management Protocol</u></i>.
