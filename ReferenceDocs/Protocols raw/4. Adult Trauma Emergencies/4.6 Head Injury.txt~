1. Perform general patient management .
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with
airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO 2 94 - 99%.
Consider supporting respirations with a BVM.
4. Immobilize patient using full spinal precautions. Avoid
excessive compression around the neck by cervical
collar. Assess and document PMS in all extremities
before and after immobilization.

HEAD INJURY

OVERVIEW:
Brain injury and its accompanying pathologic processes continue to be a leading cause
of mortality associated with trauma. Whether the injury is due to a blunt or penetrating
mechanism, bleeding or swelling of the brain and surrounding tissue may lead to an
increase in pressure within the cranial cavity, known as intracranial pressure (ICP). If
pressure within the skull is not controlled, neurologic changes may produce signs and
symptoms ranging from headache to coma with loss of protective reflexes. Blunt force
trauma may result in scalp injury, skull fracture, and meningeal and brain tissue injury.
Penetrating trauma may produce focal or diffuse injury, depending on the velocity of the
penetrating object. Although the pre-hospital provider cannot reverse the brain tissue
damage from the initial/ primary brain injury that has already occurred, they can play a
major role in preventing or limiting the processes that exacerbate and lead to a
secondary brain injury. The pre-hospital provider’s goal is to focus on reversing any
hypoxia, hypotension, hypercarbia, acidosis, or increasing intracranial pressure.

5. Obtain and document baseline GCS and
reassessments.
6. Monitor capnography, if available. Attempt to maintain
between 35 - 45 Torr.
7. Place patient on cardiac monitor.
8. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO. If time permits,
establish an additional line.
9. Obtain a blood glucose sample.
10. If patient is exhibiting signs of shock, refer to Shock
protocol.
11. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as
indicated.

PEARLS:
1.
Hyperventilation is not recommended for head-injury patients who do not have
symptoms of herniation syndrome, as auto-regulatory mechanisms are intact and
hyperventilation may worsen cerebral perfusion pressure.
2.
One of the most important indicators of worsening head injury is a change in
LOC and / or GCS.
3.
Increased ICP may cause hypertension and bradycardia (Cushing’s response).
4.
Hypotension usually indicates injury or shock unrelated to the head injury and
should be treated aggressively to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion.
5.
Supine positioning may also increase ICP transiently. The patient may benefit
from a reverse Trendelenburg position; however, it may reduce cerebral blood
flow, especially if the head is elevated greater than 30°. If the patient is
immobilized to a backboard, slightly elevate (15° or less) the head end of the
board.
